You can use Runtime Manager to view and control the Scheduler components within the flows in your deployed applications.
Use the *Schedules* tab in the left navigation menu to enable or disable Scheduler elements,
change the frequency, or run the scheduled job immediately,
all without changing the running application.

[NOTE]
Schedule management is supported on servers in a hybrid deployment environment using only Mule version 3.9 or later.

From the *Schedules* tab, you can:

* Enable or disable the Scheduler
* Change the frequency
* Specify when to start running the Scheduler
* Specify the timezone (for a cron Scheduler)


Runtime Manager lists the name of each Scheduler component as `polling://{flow_name}`.

== Use Cases

Schedule management is useful in the following contexts:

* You want to change the schedules in your application at runtime without redeploying.
* You want to disable a scheduled job while one of the applications you are connecting to is undergoing maintenance.
* You want runtime visibility into the schedules in your application.


== Considerations and Limitations

When using the *Schedules* tab, consider the following:

* If a scheduled job is not triggered because the application is not running,
Runtime Manager triggers the job as soon as the application restarts.
* When a schedule is used to trigger a flow with subflow in a Mule 4.x application, it waits until both main flow and subflow complete before scheduling the next run.
+
*Is this true? I found it in the CloudHub Schedule info.*
* The scheduler reads the job configuration every time it runs.
+
To apply your changes immediately, run your jobs manually after updating the schedule.



== View and Manage Application Schedules in Runtime Manager

To use the scheduling feature in Runtime Manager, deploy an application that includes one or more Scheduler elements:

.The arrow shows the *Scheduler* component in the Anypoint Studio canvas.

After deploying the app, view and manage the Scheduler elements in Runtime Manager:

. Click *Applications* in the left pane, click the app name, and then click *Schedules*:
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the *Schedules* option and (*2*) the checkbox on the *Schedules* page.

+
The *Name* column shows the name of the flow that contains the Scheduler element.
+
*IS THIS TRUE?* Runtime Manager lists the Scheduler elements in the order that they appear in your application.


. Select the checkbox to manage a single Scheduler:
