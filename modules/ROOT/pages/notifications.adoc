[TIP]
This document deals with calling the xref:cloudhub-api.adoc[CloudHub API]. For instructions on how to perform these same tasks more easily via the Runtime Manager UI, see xref:cloudhub.adoc[CloudHub] and its child pages.

The notifications API allows you to list notifications, create notifications and mark as read. All resources or methods that return or accept a type (except where noted) use the application JSON type. As an example, here's an example of what the result from the notifications resource looks like.

[NOTE]
Alerts and Notifications are a feature that is currently only available for applications deployed to CloudHub workers. They are not available for applications that you deploy via the Runtime Manager to local servers. See xref:deployment-strategies.adoc[Deployment Strategies] for more details.
