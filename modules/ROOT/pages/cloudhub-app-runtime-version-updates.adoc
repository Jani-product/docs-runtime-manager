When you deploy an application to CloudHub, you have access to the validated OS updates, security patches, and bug fixes that MuleSoft provides regularly.

You can keep your CloudHub applications up to date by manually updating your apps at your convenience, or you can let MuleSoft apply the updates automatically.

When a new runtime version is available for your CloudHub application, the *Applications* page displays a banner and the *Update Required* tab lists the apps that require updates:

If no apps require updates, no banner appears and the *Update Required* tab is empty.

== Update the App Manually 

The *Update Required* tab indicates that one or more apps require an update. You can schedule the update to occur at your convenience.

Before updating apps in the Production environment, update them in the Sandbox environment and run required tests.

To update an app to the latest security patch:

. In the Runtime Manager left menu, click *Applications*.
. Click the *Update Required* tab.
. Click the app status to display the details pane on the right.
. Click the *Manage Application* button to display the *Settings* page for the app.
+
If the app requires an update, *Update available* appears in the *Runtime version* field:

. Select the latest version from the *Runtime version* menu.
+
Although the version number of the update might be the same as the installed version, the date distinguishes the update.
. If you want to see details about the version, click the *Read release notes* link.
. Click the *Apply Changes* button to update the app. 

CloudHub updates the app with the version you selected and displays a message indicating success or failure.

If the app update was successful, the app no longer appears in the *Update Required* tab on the *Applications* page.

If the app update was unsuccessful, the app remains in the *Update Required* tab.
