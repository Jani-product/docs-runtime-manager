MuleSoft releases updates to Mule runtime engine to provide the latest OS and security patches. 

To keep your apps up-to-date and secure, apply the Mule updates when they become available. 

Because these updates contain required security patches, you cannot roll back these updates once applied.

When updates are available, the *Update Required* tab on the Applications page lists the apps that require updates:

The *Update Required* button also appears on the Settings page for the individual app:

== Update the App

The *Update Required* tab indicates an app requires an update to Mule runtime engine. You can schedule the update to occur at your convenience. Before updating apps in the Production environment, update them in the Sandbox environment and run required tests.

To update the Mule version for an app:

. On the *Applications* page, click the app name to display the details pane on the right.
. Click the *Manage Application* button. 
. On the Settings page, select the latest version from the *Runtime version* dropdown list.
+
You can click the *Read release notes* link to see details about the version.
. Click the *Apply Changes* button to update the app. 

CloudHub updates app with the Mule runtime engine version you selected and displays a message indicating success or failure.

If the app update was successful, the app no longer appears in the *Update Required* tab on the *Applications* page.

If the app update was unsuccessful, the app remains in the *Update Required* tab .

// If you experience a sustained outage after updating, contact MuleSoft Support.
