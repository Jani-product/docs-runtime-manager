To provide a safe cloud environment for applications and data, MuleSoft regularly scans apps deployed on CloudHub and identifies apps that require updates to Mule runtime engine.
These updates provide the latest OS and security patches. To keep your apps up-to-date and secure, apply the Mule updates when they become available.

You can schedule and update your apps manually at your convenience or you can wait for MuleSoft to apply the updates automatically.

MuleSoft updates CloudHub apps automatically, based on the environment, on this schedule:

[%header,cols="2"]
|===
|Environment |App Update Schedule 
|*Production*|Every three months
|*Sandbox*|Once every month
|===


When a new version of Mule is available and CloudHub application updates are required:

* The *Update Required* button appears on the *Settings* page for the app that requires updates.
* The *Applications* page displays a banner.
* The *Update Required* tab on the *Applications* page lists the apps that require updates:

.The screen shows (*1*) the banner and (*2*) the *Updates Required* tab on the *Applications* page.

// The banner on the Applications page indicates the date when the updates will be applied automatically.

If no apps require updates, no banner appears and the *Updates Required* tab is empty.

Because these updates contain required security patches, you cannot roll back these updates once applied.


== Update the App Manually 

The *Update Required* tab indicates one or more apps require an update to Mule. You can schedule the update to occur at your convenience.

Before updating apps in the Production environment, update them in the Sandbox environment and run required tests.

To update the Mule version for an app:

. In Runtime Manager, in the menu on the left, click *Applications*. 
. On the *Applications* page, click the app status to display the details pane on the right.
. In the details pane, click the *Manage Application* button.
+
The *Settings* page for the app appears. If the Mule runtime version requires an update, *Update Required* appears in the *Runtime version* field:
+
.The screen shows (*1*) the *Update Required* button and (*2*) the *Runtime version* menu on the *Settings* page.

. Select the latest version from the *Runtime version* menu.
. If you want to see details about the version, click the *Read release notes* link.
. Click the *Apply Changes* button to update the app. 

CloudHub updates app with the Mule runtime engine version you selected and displays a message indicating success or failure.

If the app update was successful, the app no longer appears in the *Update Required* tab on the *Applications* page.

If the app update was unsuccessful, the app remains in the *Update Required* tab .

// If you experience a sustained outage after updating, contact MuleSoft Support.
