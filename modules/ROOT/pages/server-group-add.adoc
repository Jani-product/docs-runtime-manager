If you want to add a server to a group that is currently running an existing application, you must first stop and and delete the application before you can add the server to a group.

Before adding a server to a server group, ensure that you have:

* Installed and configured Mule.
* Installed and configured the Runtime Manager Agent.
* Created a server in Runtime Manager.

Remember that you must first register each of the servers to Runtime Manager by downloading and installing the same version of https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/mule[Mule] and then running the xref:managing-servers.adoc#add-a-server[amc_setup] script on each.

. From the *Servers* screen, click a server to view the additional menu, and click *Add Servers*:
