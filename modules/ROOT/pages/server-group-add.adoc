== Prerequisites

Before you can add servers to a server group, you must:

* Install and configure Mule.
* Create and configure the servers.
* Register each of the servers to Runtime Manager by downloading and installing the same version of https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/mule[Mule] and then running the xref:managing-servers.adoc#add-a-server[amc_setup] script on each.

[NOTES]
--
* All servers in a server group must be running the same Mule version and the same Runtime Manager agent version. 
* You can create a server group with servers that display the statuses of `Running` or `Disconnected`, but these can't be mixed with servers that display the status `Created`. 
* You can create a server group with servers that all display the status `Created`.
* If you want to add a server on which existing applications are currently running to a server group, you must first stop and delete the applications from the server.
