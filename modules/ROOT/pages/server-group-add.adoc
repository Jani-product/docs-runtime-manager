If you want to add a server on which existing applications are currently running, you must first stop and delete the applications from the server. 

== Prerequisites

* Install and configure Mule.
* Install and configure the Runtime Manager agent.
* Create a server in Runtime Manager.

Remember that you must first register each of the servers to Runtime Manager by downloading and installing the same version of https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/mule[Mule] and then running the xref:managing-servers.adoc#add-a-server[amc_setup] script on each.

. From the *Servers* screen, click a server to view the additional menu, and click *Add Servers*:
