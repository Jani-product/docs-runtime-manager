== Prerequisites

Before you can add servers to a server group, you must:

. Download and install the same version of the https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/mule[Mule] to register each server. 
. Run the `amc_setup` script to create the servers.
+
See xref:servers-create.adoc[Create a Server in Runtime Manager].


== Considerations 

* All servers in a server group must be running the same Mule version and the same Runtime Manager agent version. 
* You can create a server group with servers that display the statuses of `Running` or `Disconnected`, but these can't be mixed with servers that display the status `Created`. 
* You can create a server group with servers that all display the status `Created`.
* If you want to add a server on which existing applications are currently running to a server group, you must first stop and delete the applications from the server. 

== Add Servers to a Group

. From the *Servers* page, click the row of the server group to view the management menu, and click *Add Server*.
