After you deploy your application, you can use Runtime Manager to monitor the application's performance. If you deployed the application to an on-premises server, you can also monitor the server. 

Depending on the xref:deployment-strategies.adoc[deployment strategy] you use, there is a different set of possible monitoring resources available, including alerts, dashboards, notifications, and flow metrics. 

== Monitoring Servers

On applications that are deployed on-premises, you can use the following tools to get information about the servers.

* xref:alerts-on-runtime-manager.adoc#conditions-on-mule-servers[Alerts] – image:logo-hybrid-active.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies", title="Hybrid Deployment"]

Send e-mail alerts whenever key events occur. A history of when these alerts were triggered can also be accessed.
