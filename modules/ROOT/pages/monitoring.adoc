After you deploy your application, use the monitoring dashboards in Runtime Manager to monitor the application's performance. If you deployed the application to an on-premises server, you can also monitor the server. 

Depending on the xref:deployment-strategies.adoc[deployment strategy] you use, different monitoring resources are available, including alerts, dashboards, notifications, and flow metrics. 

== Monitoring Servers

On applications that are deployed on-premises, use the following tools to get information about the servers.

Send e-mail alerts whenever key events occur. A history of when these alerts were triggered can also be accessed.
