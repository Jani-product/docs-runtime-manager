If your company security policies require that you perform vulnerability and penetration testing 
before deploying to Anypoint Platform, you must request a Security Assessment before proceeding 
with your testing on Anypoint Platform.

Because these tests can interfere with other tenants, MuleSoft allows penetration testing on only your workers
but not for other Anypoint Platform services.

== Prerequisites

Before penetration testing, enable static IPs for the app.

By default, CloudHub workers do not use static IP addresses, so you can't test them because their IP addresses might change.
For information about how to enable static IPs, see xref:deploying-to-cloudhub.adoc#static-ips-tab-settings[Static IPs Tab Settings].
