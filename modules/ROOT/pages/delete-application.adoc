Use the xref:cloudhub-api.adoc[CloudHub API] to delete an application.

[TIP]
For instructions on how to perform these same tasks more easily via the Runtime Manager UI, see xref:cloudhub.adoc[CloudHub].

The DELETE operation, specified with the `/api/applications/{domain}` (where `{domain}` is the application domain), deletes the specified application.

*Example Request:*

DELETE https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/cloudhub/api/applications/domain
