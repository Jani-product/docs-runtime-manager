= Export Data to External Analytics Tools (Hybrid)
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

To send the event notifications of your Mule applications to 3rd party tool such as Splunk and ELK, configure Runtime Manager to export data to external analytics tools.

This functionality is only available in hybrid deployment scenarios. It is not available for applications deployed to CloudHub.

== Basic Architecture

The Runtime Manager exists as:

* a component of the Anypoint Platform.
* a component of the Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition that you can install on-premises.

Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition has a Runtime Manager that handles only applications that are deployed on-premises. The cloud-based version of Anypoint Platform has a Runtime Manager that allows you manage applications deployed to xref:index.adoc[CloudHub] as well as applications that are deployed on-premises and to your own cloud servers. When using whichever version of the Runtime Manager, there's always a way to monitor your applications.

Applications deployed to CloudHub can use xref:insight.adoc[Insight]: MuleSoft’s Analytics & Monitoring feature. Applications that you deploy on-premises or to your own cloud servers can be integrated into third-party analytics applications, which is what this document describes.

////
Applications deployed on Cloud can either use Insights (MuleSoft’s Analytics & Monitoring feature) or be integrated into third party analytics applications for a unified view of monitoring and analytics. Apps deployed on on-prem must be integrated into third party analytics applications.
////

If you deploy apps from Runtime Manager to customer-managed Mule servers, you can send your Mule app event and analytics data to third party analytics software such as Elk and Splunk.

[NOTE]
Sending data to third party software is not currently available for applications on xref:cloudhub.adoc[CloudHub]. See xref:deployment-strategies.adoc[Deployment Strategies] for more details.

Integration between Runtime Manager and third-party analytics software looks like this:

image::amc-onprem-diagram-detail.jpg[]

The xref:runtime-manager-agent.adoc[Runtime Manager Agent] acts in between Runtime Manager and the third party software. The agent enables integration and sends event notifications to your third party analytics tool.

== Prerequisites

* Mule 3.6 or later, or API gateway standalone version 2.1.0 or later if you deal with apps that are built with the API gateway.
* Runtime Manager agent 1.2.0 or later is required, the steps to install and configure it are provided below.

== Installation and Setup of Runtime Manager with a Third-Party Analytics Tool

In order to have Runtime Manager send data to an external analytics tool, you must follow these steps, which are explained in detail further down.

image::steps-for-external-logs.png[steps]

=== Update the Runtime Manager Agent

First you must install the latest version of the Runtime Manager agent, which is in charge of sending messages out of mule. In order to send event information to third party software, you need to have version 1.2.0 or later of the Runtime Manager agent.
See xref:installing-and-configuring-runtime-manager-agent.adoc[installing and configuring Runtime Manager Agent].

[NOTE]
====
Although Runtime Manager agent exists by default bundled with Mule as of version 3.7, all Mule versions older than 3.7.2 contain an old version of Runtime Manager agent that doesn't support this feature. You must download the latest version of the Runtime Manager agent separately if your Mule version is older than 3.7.2.

http://mule-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/1.2.0/mule-agent-1.2.0.zip[Download Runtime Manager Agent]
====

=== Register the Runtime Manager Agent

Place the agent file in your `{MULE_HOME}/bin` folder, and then you must register it to the Runtime Manager by running a command in the terminal. Depending on whether you wish to use Runtime Manager through the cloud platform or as part of the Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition, you must pass this command a different set of arguments to register it. To obtain the basic command that you must run (complete with your Runtime Manager instance ID) you must do the following:

To obtain this code, you must do the following:

. Sign in to your Anypoint Platform account.
+
[TIP]
To open Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition, make sure you've already initiated Runtime Manager. If you haven't then you must boot it by running docker. Once initiated, you can access it by navigating to +https://localhost+ in a browser.

. Navigate to *Runtime Manager > Servers*.
. Click *Add Server*. Without needing to actually add a new server, a sample command will be displayed in a popup window that includes the code for your particular organization. Copy this command, depending on where you wish to deploy, you may need to add extra arguments to it.

=== Anypoint Platform Cloud

When using Runtime Manager as part of the cloud-based Anypoint Platform, launch the agent with exactly the same command that you found on the Runtime Manager UI:

`+amc_setup -H 1c3eded9-7917-4a5e-bbe0-f73f9d4f33c1---2 myServer+`

or on Windows:

`+amc_setup.bat -H 1c3eded9-7917-4a5e-bbe0-f73f9d4f33c1---2 myServer+`

The argument `-H` is an id that references your organization in the Anypoint Platform installation.

The final argument of this command is the name that you assign for your Runtime Manager agent instance, in the above example, `myServer`. This name will then be visible when interacting with the agent from your Runtime Manager console.

[discrete.view]
=== Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition

When using Anypoint Platform as an application running on-premises, launch the agent with the following arguments:

`+amc_setup -A http://localhost:8080/hybrid/api/v1 -W wss://localhost:8443/mule -C https://dev.anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts -H 361755d7-c619-42ce-9187-19db7a6d94a0---2 myServer+`

or on Windows:

`+amc_setup.bat -A http://localhost:8080/hybrid/api/v1 -W wss://localhost:8443/mule -C https://dev.anypoint.mulesoft.com/accounts -H 361755d7-c619-42ce-9187-19db7a6d94a0---2 myServer+`

The argument `-H` is an id that references your organization in Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition installation.

The final argument of this command is the name that you assign for your Runtime Manager agent instance, in the above example, `myServer`. This name will then be visible when interacting with the agent from your Runtime Manager console.

Note that three extra arguments must be added to what you copied from the Runtime Manager UI: -A, -W and -C.
* *A* sets the Runtime Manager host address
* *C* sets the Access Management host address
* *W* sets the Mule Communications Manager (MCM) host address

=====

=== Update the Runtime Manager Agent

If you update the Runtime Manager agent version, it isn't necessary to undeploy the running apps.


[TIP]
For more information on how to install or Update the Runtime Manager agent, see xref:installing-and-configuring-runtime-manager-agent.adoc[installing and configuring Runtime Manager Agent]

[NOTE]
Creating multiple agents within a single server is not supported.

==== Verifying Agent Registration

After running the above command, open Runtime Manager to verify that the agent has been registered successfully:

. Sign in to Anypoint Platform with your credentials
. Go to `Runtime Manager - > Servers`. You should now see that one of those servers is your Runtime Manager agent instance, named with the name you provided when installing it:

image::verify-agent.jpg[]

=== Configure Mule Custom Events

You can configure the Runtime Manager to send out Mule Events to external software, this includes flow executions, exceptions raised, etc. This works with apps deployed to any runtime, and for both the Runtime Manager in the cloud and the Runtime Manager that comes bundled with the xref:1.5@private-cloud::index.adoc[Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition].

==== Integrating with Splunk

With http://www.splunk.com/[Splunk] you can capture and index Mule event notification data into a searchable repository from which you can then generate graphs, reports, alerts, dashboards and visualizations.

image::amc-onprem-diagram-detail-splunk.jpg[]

===== Configuring your Splunk Account

In order to achieve this you must configure a new source type on your Splunk instance with the correct configuration to parse the HTTP events sent from the API gateway.
To do this, you have to append the following source type to the `$SPLUNK_HOME/opt/splunk/etc/system/local/props.conf`
file.

....
[mule]
TRUNCATE = 0
LINE_BREAKER = ([\r\n]+)
SHOULD_LINEMERGE = false
INDEXED_EXTRACTIONS = JSON
KV_MODE = JSON
category = Mule Splunk Integration
description = Mule Agent event information
....

[NOTE]
If this file doesn't exist yet, you must create it.

After making these changes, you must restart your Splunk instance for them to take effect.

==== Integrating with an ELK Stack

ELK combines three open source tools (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) that work together to help you store, search and analyze log data. You can output the Mule event notifications as generic system logs, which can be handled by your ELK stack. Logstash captures and indexes the data into the log, from which you can then use Elasticsearch and Kibana to generate graphs, reports, alerts, dashboards and visualizations.
The Runtime Manager agent helps you store all of the Event Notifications produced from the Mule runtime flows into a configurable log file with a rolling file policy.

image::amc-onprem-diagram-detail-elk.jpg[]

To direct information to the folder where your ELK stack reads from, you must do the following:

. Select the server whose information you want to send out.
. In the menu on the right, click *Manage Server* to access the server settings.
+
image::sending-data-from-arm-to-external-monitoring-software-manage-server.png[]

. Select the *Plugins* tab:

. Select the kind of information that you want to send out in the *Level* dropdown menu
+
image::sending-data-from-arm-to-external-monitoring-software-level.png[]

. On the *Event Tracking* region, activate the *ELK* switch. This will open a pop up menu where you can provide the address to the folder where you keep the log files that your ELK stack reads.
+
image::sending-data-from-arm-to-external-monitoring-software-elk.png[]

. Optionally, you can open the advanced menu and set up certain formatting properties of the data you send out and how the information is archived.
+
image::elk-config-advanced.jpg[ELK advanced]

[discrete.view]
=== Configure API Analytics

Before you can set up the connection to external software through the Runtime Manager UI, you must first make some changes to the API gateway to prepare it for this.

. In your API gateway standalone directory, look for the `conf/wrapper.conf` file
. In it find the following line and make sure that the property is set to "true"
+
[source,java,linenums]
----
wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.analytics_enabled=true
----

. Look for this other line:
+
[source,java,linenums]
----
wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.analytics_base_uri=https://analytics-ingest.anypoint.mulesoft.com
----
. Remove the URL in it, so that it looks like this:
+
[source,java,linenums]
----
wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.analytics_base_uri=
----
. When using Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition, there's one more parameter you need to change:
+
[source,java,linenums]
----
wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.on_prem=true
----
+
`anypoint.platform.on_prem` is set to `false` by default. To manage it through Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition, you must set it to `true`. To manage it through the Runtime Manager in the cloud, leave it as `false`.

[TIP]
Note that in the above code snippets, when lines that contain `.<n>`, that should be replaced with an integer number that is unique within the wrapper.

Once you have set up your Stand Alone API gateway, the steps for connecting to Splunk and ELK are identical to those when dealing with Mule Custom Events, except that you should set them up via the corresponding switches.

image::sending-data-from-arm-to-external-monitoring-software-api-analytics.png[]

[NOTE]
--
Starting from Mule versions 4.2.0 and 3.9.3, you can configure the Mule runtime engine to forward events to both a third-party system, like ELK and Splunk, and to Anypoint Platform by adding an additional property to the `wrapper.conf` file:

[source,java,linenums]
----
wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.analytics_multiple_consumers_enabled=true
----
--

[WARNING]
If you modify your `wrapper.conf` file as described above but don't assign an external destination for your data (as you can do via the Runtime Manager UI), then this analytics data will be stored in a queue in the server where the API gateway is being run and could pile up to the point of crashing the system.

[discrete.view]
== Integrating API Analytics with Splunk and ELK

Once you've configured your API gateway, you can now return to Runtime Manager and see that your servers have some additional options in their menu.

image::sending-data-from-arm-to-external-monitoring-software-api-analytics.png[]

You can now set up the sending of API analytics to both Splunk and ELK, you configure exactly in the same way as you do when sending business events to them. See <<Integrating with an ELK Stack, Integrating with an ELK Stack>> and <<Integrating with Splunk, Integrating with Splunk>>.

[discrete.view]
== Payload Formats

If you intend to export your payload's contents to be logged, keep in mind that not all formats can be exported. See xref:about-logging-of-payload-formats.adoc[About Logging of Payload Formats] for a full reference.

[discrete.view]
== Encrypting Passwords

Assign a master password to your Mule instance or your API gateway standalone instance when launching them. If you don't, when you set up your credentials for external applications using the Runtime Manager UI, the credentials are stored as plain text in the `conf/mule-agent.yml` file. This is not recommended for security reasons. Instead, launch Mule or API gateway runtime with an extra argument that is then used to encrypt these passwords when storing them in the YAML file.

[discrete.view]
=== Mule

----
{MULE_HOME}/bin/mule -M-Dmule.agent.configuration.password=myMasterPassword
----

or on Windows:

----
{MULE_HOME}\bin\mule.bat -M-Dmule.agent.configuration.password=myMasterPassword
----


[discrete.view]
=== API Gateway - Deprecated

----
{MULE_HOME}/bin/gateway -M-Dmule.agent.configuration.password=myMasterPassword
----

or on Windows:

----
{MULE_HOME}\bin\gateway.bat -M-Dmule.agent.configuration.password=myMasterPassword
----

=====

To have access to these encrypted passwords when you restart Mule or API gateway, you must assign the same master password you used when generating them.
If you decide to change the master password or you omit it when you launch the runtime, you must reassign your passwords through the Runtime Manager UI to keep the third-party integrations working.
