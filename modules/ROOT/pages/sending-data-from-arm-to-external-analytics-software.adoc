To send the event notifications of your Mule applications to 3rd party tool such as Splunk and ELK, configure Runtime Manager to export data to external analytics tools.

This functionality is only available in hybrid deployment scenarios. It is not available for applications deployed to CloudHub.


If you intend to export your payload's contents to be logged, keep in mind that not all formats can be exported. See xref:about-logging-of-payload-formats.adoc[Payload Formats and Logging].


== Basic Architecture

The Runtime Manager exists as:

* a component of the Anypoint Platform.
* a component of the Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition that you can install on-premises.

Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition has a Runtime Manager that handles only applications that are deployed on-premises. The cloud-based version of Anypoint Platform has a Runtime Manager that allows you manage applications deployed to xref:index.adoc[CloudHub] as well as applications that are deployed on-premises and to your own cloud servers. When using whichever version of the Runtime Manager, there's always a way to monitor your applications.

Applications deployed to CloudHub can use xref:insight.adoc[Insight]: MuleSoft’s Analytics & Monitoring feature. Applications that you deploy on-premises or to your own cloud servers can be integrated into third-party analytics applications, which is what this document describes.

////
Applications deployed on Cloud can either use Insights (MuleSoft’s Analytics & Monitoring feature) or be integrated into third party analytics applications for a unified view of monitoring and analytics. Apps deployed on on-prem must be integrated into third party analytics applications.
////

If you deploy apps from Runtime Manager to customer-managed Mule servers, you can send your Mule app event and analytics data to third party analytics software such as Elk and Splunk.

Sending data to third party software is currently not available (out of the box) for applications on xref:cloudhub.adoc[CloudHub].
One way to achieve this is by using the https://docs.mulesoft.com/runtime-manager/custom-log-appender[CloudHub custom log appender].

Integration between Runtime Manager and third-party analytics software looks like this:

image::amc-onprem-diagram-detail.jpg[]

The xref:runtime-manager-agent.adoc[Runtime Manager agent] acts in between Runtime Manager and the third party software. The agent enables integration and sends event notifications to your third party analytics tool.

== Prerequisites

* Mule 3.6 or later, or API gateway standalone version 2.1.0 or later
* Runtime Manager agent 1.2.0 or later is required
+
See xref:installing-and-configuring-runtime-manager-agent.adoc[Install or Update the Runtime Manager Agent].

== Use Runtime Manager with a Third-Party Analytics Tool

In order to have Runtime Manager send data to an external analytics tool, you must follow these steps, which are explained in detail further down.

image::steps-for-external-logs.png[steps]


== Configuring Mule Custom Events

You can configure the Runtime Manager to send out Mule Events to external software, this includes flow executions, exceptions raised, etc. This works with apps deployed to any runtime, and for both the Runtime Manager in the cloud and the Runtime Manager that comes bundled with the xref:1.5@private-cloud::index.adoc[Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition].

=== Integrate with Splunk

With http://www.splunk.com/[Splunk], you can capture and index Mule event notification data into a searchable repository from which you can then generate graphs, reports, alerts, dashboards and visualizations.

image::amc-onprem-diagram-detail-splunk.jpg[]

To integrate with Splunk, you must configure a new source type on your Splunk instance with the correct configuration to parse the HTTP events sent from the API gateway.
To do this, append the following source type to the `$SPLUNK_HOME/opt/splunk/etc/system/local/props.conf`
file.

[source,yaml,linenums]
----
[mule]
TRUNCATE = 0
LINE_BREAKER = ([\r\n]+)
SHOULD_LINEMERGE = false
INDEXED_EXTRACTIONS = JSON
KV_MODE = JSON
category = Mule Splunk Integration
description = Mule Agent event information
----

If this file doesn't exist, you must create it.

Restart your Splunk instance for your changes to take effect.

+
image::agent-to-splunk-tcp.png[splunk]

=== Integrate with an ELK Stack

ELK combines three open source tools (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) that work together to help you store, search and analyze log data. You can output the Mule event notifications as generic system logs, which can be handled by your ELK stack. Logstash captures and indexes the data into the log, from which you can then use Elasticsearch and Kibana to generate graphs, reports, alerts, dashboards and visualizations.
The Runtime Manager agent helps you store all of the Event Notifications produced from the Mule runtime flows into a configurable log file with a rolling file policy.

image::amc-onprem-diagram-detail-elk.jpg[]

To direct information to the folder where your ELK stack reads from, you must do the following:

. Select the server whose information you want to send out.
. In the menu on the right, click *Manage Server* to access the server settings.
+
image::sending-data-from-arm-to-external-monitoring-software-manage-server.png[]

. Select the *Plugins* tab:
+
image::sending-data-from-arm-to-external-monitoring-software-plugins.png[]

. Select the kind of information that you want to send out in the *Level* dropdown menu
+
image::sending-data-from-arm-to-external-monitoring-software-level.png[]

. On the *Event Tracking* region, activate the *ELK* switch. This will open a pop up menu where you can provide the address to the folder where you keep the log files that your ELK stack reads.
+
image::sending-data-from-arm-to-external-monitoring-software-elk.png[]

. Optionally, you can open the advanced menu and set up certain formatting properties of the data you send out and how the information is archived.
+
image::elk-config-advanced.jpg[ELK advanced]


== Configuring API Analytics

Before you can set up the connection to external software through the Runtime Manager UI, you must first make some changes to the API gateway to prepare it for this.

. In your API gateway standalone directory, open the `conf/wrapper.conf` file.
. Ensure that the following property is set to `true` and that the line is uncommented:
+
[source,java,linenums]
----
wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.analytics_enabled=true
----

. Look for this other line:
+
[source,java,linenums]
----
wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.analytics_base_uri=https://analytics-ingest.anypoint.mulesoft.com
----
. Remove the URL in it, so that it looks like this:
+
[source,java,linenums]
----
wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.analytics_base_uri=
----
. When using Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition, there's one more parameter you need to change:
+
[source,java,linenums]
----
wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.on_prem=true
----
+
`anypoint.platform.on_prem` is set to `false` by default. To manage it through Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition, you must set it to `true`. To manage it through the Runtime Manager in the cloud, leave it as `false`.

[TIP]
Note that in the above code snippets, when lines that contain `.<n>`, that should be replaced with an integer number that is unique within the wrapper.

After you set up your standalone API gateway, the steps for connecting to Splunk and ELK are identical to those when dealing with Mule Custom Events, except that you should set them up via the corresponding switches.

image::sending-data-from-arm-to-external-monitoring-software-api-analytics.png[]

[NOTE]
--
Starting from Mule versions 4.2.0 and 3.9.3, you can configure the Mule runtime engine to forward events to both a third-party system, like ELK and Splunk, and to Anypoint Platform by adding an additional property to the `wrapper.conf` file:

[source,java,linenums]
----
wrapper.java.additional.<n>=-Danypoint.platform.analytics_multiple_consumers_enabled=true
----
--

[WARNING]
If you modify your `wrapper.conf` file as described above but don't assign an external destination for your data (as you can do via the Runtime Manager UI), then this analytics data will be stored in a queue in the server where the API gateway is being run and could pile up to the point of crashing the system.


=== Integrate API Analytics with Splunk and ELK

After you've configured your API gateway, you can now return to Runtime Manager and see that your servers have some additional options in their menu.

image::sending-data-from-arm-to-external-monitoring-software-api-analytics.png[]

You can now set up the sending of API analytics to both Splunk and ELK, you configure exactly in the same way as you do when sending business events to them. See <<Integrating with an ELK Stack, Integrating with an ELK Stack>> and <<Integrating with Splunk, Integrating with Splunk>>.


This section can be removed, I think VVVV

== Encrypting Passwords

Assign a master password to your Mule instance or your API gateway standalone instance when launching them. If you don't, when you set up your credentials for external applications using the Runtime Manager UI, the credentials are stored as plain text in the `conf/mule-agent.yml` file. This is not recommended for security reasons. Instead, launch Mule or API gateway runtime with an extra argument that is then used to encrypt these passwords when storing them in the YAML file.

To encrypt passwords on Mule:

----
{MULE_HOME}/bin/mule -M-Dmule.agent.configuration.password=myMasterPassword
----

Use this command on Windows:

----
{MULE_HOME}\bin\mule.bat -M-Dmule.agent.configuration.password=myMasterPassword
----

To encrypt passwords on API Gateway (deprecated):

----
{MULE_HOME}/bin/gateway -M-Dmule.agent.configuration.password=myMasterPassword
----

Use this command on Windows:

----
{MULE_HOME}\bin\gateway.bat -M-Dmule.agent.configuration.password=myMasterPassword
----


To have access to these encrypted passwords when you restart Mule or API gateway, you must assign the same master password you used when generating them.
If you decide to change the master password or you omit it when you launch the runtime, you must reassign your passwords through the Runtime Manager UI to keep the third-party integrations working.
