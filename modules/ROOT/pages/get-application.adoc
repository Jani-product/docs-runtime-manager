[TIP]
This document deals with calling the xref:cloudhub-api.adoc[CloudHub API]. For instructions on how to perform these same tasks more easily via the Runtime Manager UI, see xref:cloudhub.adoc[CloudHub] and its child pages.

The GET operation specified with the `/api/applications/{domain}` resource retrieves an application, where `{domain}` is the application domain.

*Example Request:*

[source,json,linenums]
----
GET https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/cloudhub/api/applications/hello
----

*Example Response:*

[source,json,linenums]

  "domain":"hello",
  "fullDomain":"hello.cloudhub.io",
  "workers":1,
  "hasFile":false,
  "muleVersion":"3.7.0",
  "properties": {
    "foo":"bar"
