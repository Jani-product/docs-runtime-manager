[TIP]
These examples show calling the xref:cloudhub-api.adoc[CloudHub API]. For instructions on how to perform these same tasks more easily using the Runtime Manager UI, see xref:cloudhub.adoc[CloudHub] and its child pages.

The `PUT` method, specified with the `/api/applications/{domain}` resource (where `{domain}` is the application domain), updates your application metadata, including the number of workers and system properties. You can also use it to update an existing application. For information on how to update you application, see xref:managing-applications-on-cloudhub.adoc[Updating Your Application].

The update operation can update the `workers`, `properties`, `muleVersion`, and `filename` properties. Properties which are not specified are not updated.
