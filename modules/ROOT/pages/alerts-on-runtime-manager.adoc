Set up alerts to send email notifications when application or server events occur. 

Runtime Manager includes several standard alert types that trigger notifications for common events:

* An application exceeds a specific number of events processed within a timeframe.
* A deployment completes with success or failure.
* CloudHub encounters a problem with the worker on an application via the worker monitoring system.
* A server is disconnected or deleted.

You can also create custom alerts for applications deployed to CloudHub.
Custom alerts are triggered when your application sends notifications to the Runtime Manager console
using Anypoint Connector for CloudHub (CloudHub Connector).
See xref:custom-application-alerts.adoc[Custom Application Alerts] for information.

== Rate Limits on Alerts

Anypoint Platform enforces rate limits that determine how often an alert is triggered and prevent excessive emails from being sent.
The following factors determine the rate limit:

* CloudHub
+
When using CloudHub Connector to trigger notifications and alerts,
the rate limit is five custom application alerts per IP address, per second.
This limit is enforced by IP address. 
If an application uses multiple workers, this limit is multiplied by the number of workers
assigned to the application.
+
Custom notifications that trigger emails are also subject to the rate limit on email notifications.
* Alert emails
+
For both standard and custom alerts, the rate limit is one alert notification email sent every 2.5 seconds.
This limit is enforced by a combination of organization, environment, alert (name/ID), and resource
(application, server, server group, or cluster).

== Create an Alert

To create an alert:

. In Runtime Manager, click *Alerts* in the left navigation pane.
+
** If no alerts are set up, you see:
+
.The arrow shows the *Create your first alert* option.
image::alerts-no-alerts.png[Alerts page with no alerts set up]
** If your account already has associated alerts, you see:
+
.The arrow shows the blue plus (*+*) icon on the *Alerts* page.
image::alerts-create-additional-alert.png[Alerts page with blue plus (+) icon]

. Click the blue plus (*+*) icon to create an alert.
+
image::alerts-create-alert.png[Create an Alert page]

. Complete the required fields:

* *Name*
+
Unique and meaningful name for the alert
* *Severity Level*
+
Severity of the alert: `critical`, `warning`, or `info`

* *Source*
+
The source of the alert: applications or servers
+
This field appears only if your Anypoint Platform account supports local servers.
* *Application type* 
+
When the source is *Applications*, applications deployed to either CloudHub or local servers
+
You can't create an alert that applies to both applications deployed to CloudHub and local servers.
You must create separate alerts for each deployment type.
+
* *Server type*
+
When the source is *Servers*, the type of server: single server, server group, or cluster.
+
If your servers aren't available on your menu, see xref:managing-servers.adoc[Servers, Server Groups, and Clusters].
* *Applications* or *Servers*
+
The application or server to apply the alert to
* *Condition*
+
The condition that triggers the alert
+
The available options depend on whether your alert is linked to a server,
an application running on CloudHub, or an application running locally.
Some conditions require additional data.
See <<Alert Conditions>>.
* *Subject*
+
The subject of the alert email to send when the alert is triggered.
+
The subject can include variables.
See <<Alert Properties>>.
* *Message*
+
The body text for the email to send when the alert is triggered.
The message body can include variables.
See <<Alert Properties>>.
* *Recipients*
+
The recipients of the alert email
+
You can select platform users or enter any email address.

. Click *Create Alert*.

When an event that meets an alert condition occurs, an email like the following is sent:

image::alerts-alert-email.png[Anypoint Platform Alert Notification email]


== Alert Conditions

You can select different conditions depending on the alert source.
Some conditions are simple success or failure notifications, such as `Deployment success`.
Some more complex conditions require that you define parameters that appear as new fields in the form.

=== Conditions for Applications Deployed to CloudHub

This alert condition depends on the events you are tracking in your application.
For information, see xref:mule-runtime::business-events.adoc[Business Events].
--

Memory usage - Cloudhub::
+
--
The percentage of the total memory allocated to the CloudHub workers that run the application, including the memory consumed by the JVM itself, reaches a capacity threshold for a specified period.
