Set up alerts that send an email notification when certain application or server events occur. 
Runtime Manager includes several *standard alert* types that trigger notifications for common events:

* An application exceeds a certain number of events processed within a certain time period.
* A deployment completes with success or failure.
* CloudHub encounters a problem with the worker on an application via the worker monitoring system.
* A server is disconnected or deleted.

CloudHub also enables you to create a custom alert for an application. Custom alerts are triggered by notifications that your application sends to Runtime Manager console using the CloudHub Connector. See xref:custom-application-alerts.adoc[Custom Application Alerts] for more information. Custom alerts are available only for applications deployed to CloudHub. You cannot configure an alert for an application deployed to a customer-hosted runtime.

== Access Alerts

You can view alerts in Runtime Manager in a few ways.

* In Runtime Manager, click the *Alerts* tab to display a full list of alerts on your account.
* In the menu on the left, click the *Applications* tab, click an application to open the xref:managing-deployed-applications.adoc#applications-dashboard[application dashboard], then click the *View Associated Alerts* link.
* In the menu on the left, click the *Servers* tab, click a server to open the xref:managing-servers.adoc#servers-dashboard[servers dashboard], then click the *View Associated Alerts* link.

== Rate Limits on Alerts

Anypoint Platform enforces rate limits that determine how often an alert is triggered. These limits prevent excessive emails from being sent. The rate limit is determined by several factors, including:

* CloudHub
+
When using CloudHub-Connector to trigger notifications and alerts, there is a limit of five custom application alerts per IP address, per second. If an application uses multiple workers, this limit is multiplied by the number of workers assigned to the application, since the limitation is enforced per IP. +
Custom notifications that trigger emails are also subject to the rate limit on email notifications described below.
* Alert emails
+
Both standard and custom alerts have a rate limit where only one alert notification email is sent every 2.5 seconds. This limit is enforced by a combination of organization, environment, alert (name/ID), and resource (application, server, server group, or cluster).


== Create an Alert

If you access the alerts screen through any of the paths listed above and you don't have any alerts set up yet, you see the following screen:

.The arrow shows the *Create your first alert* option.
image::alerts-no-alerts.png[Alerts page with no alerts set up]

. Click the blue plus (*+*) icon to create your first alert.
+
image::alerts-create-alert.png[Create an Alert page]

. Fill in the required fields:

* *Name*
+
Unique and meaningful name for the alert
* *Severity Level*
+
Severity level: Critical, Warning, or Info
+
[NOTE]
Different severity levels currently have no effect on alerts, but will in the future when further features are released.

* *Source*
+
The source of the alert: applications or servers
+
This field appears only if your Anypoint Platform account supports local servers.
* *Application type* 
+
When the source is *Applications*, applications deployed to either CloudHub or local servers
+
[NOTE]
You can't create a single alert that spans applications deployed to both CloudHub and local servers. You must create two separate alerts to reach both types.
+
* *Server type*
+
When the source is *Servers*, the type of server: single server, server group, or cluster.
+
If your servers aren't available on your menu, see xref:managing-servers.adoc[Servers, Server Groups, and Clusters].
* *Applications* or *Servers*
+
The application or server to apply the alert to
* *Condition*
+
The condition that triggers the alert
+
The options depend on whether your alert is linked to a server, an application running on CloudHub, or an application running locally.
Some conditions require additional data. See <<Alert Conditions>>.
* *Subject*
+
Subject of the alert email that will be sent.
+
The subject can include variables. See <<Alert Properties>>.
* *Message*
+
The body text for the email.
The message can include variables. See <<Alert Properties>>.
* *Recipients*
+
The recipients of the alert email
+
You can select platform users or enter any email address.

. Click *Create Alert*.

. If an event that meets an alert condition occurs, an email like the following is sent:
+
image::alerts-alert-email.png[Anypoint Platform Alert Notification email]


== Alert Conditions

You can select different conditions depending on the alert source.
Some conditions are simple success or failure notifications such as `Deployment success`.
Some more complex conditions require you to define parameters that appear as new fields in the form.

=== Conditions on CloudHub Deployed Applications


image:logo-cloud-active.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies#cloudhub", title="CloudHub"]
image:logo-hybrid-disabled.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies#hybrid", title="Hybrid"]
image:logo-server-disabled.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies#anypoint-platform-private-cloud-edition", title="Anypoint Platform PCE"]
image:logo-rtf-disabled.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies#anypoint-runtime-fabric", title="Runtime Fabric"]


For applications deployed to CloudHub, the following alert conditions apply:

* *CPU usage - Cloudhub*
+
CPU usage of the CloudHub workers that run the application
+
image::alerts-conditions-apps-cpu.png[CPU usage - Cloudhub]
+
To enable this condition, you must specify capacity threshold and duration that triggers the alert.

* *Memory usage - Cloudhub*
+
Percentage of total memory allocated to the CloudHub workers that run the application, including the memory consumed by the JVM itself
+
image::alerts-conditions-apps-memory.png[Memory usage - Cloudhub]
+
To enable this condition, you must specify the capacity threshold and duration that triggers the alert.

* *Custom Notification alert* â€“ Looks at custom notifications and alerts when one contains specified text.
+
image::alerts-conditions-custom.png[Custom application alerts]
+
To enable this condition, you must specify the notifications that are the output of a CloudHub connector. This connector must exist in your Mule application. An alert is raised when the text in one of the notifications matches or contains the string that you provide in the *Contains* field. See xref:custom-application-alerts.adoc[Custom Application Alerts] for more information.
+
On *Custom Notification Alerts*, you can access a set of alert properties that you can compile into the notification message to provide more context.


* *Exceeds event traffic threshold*
+
image::alerts-conditions-exceeds-traffic.png[Exceeds event traffic threshold]
+
To enable this condition, you must specify the duration and capacity threshold that triggers the alert. This threshold applies to all events of any type.
If during a certain period you get more than N events, you get an alert.
The meaning of this depends on the events you are tracking on your application.
For more information on event tracking, see xref:mule-runtime::business-events.adoc[Business Events].


* *Secure data gateway disconnected*
* *Secure data gateway connected*
* *Worker not responding*
* *Deployment success*
* *Deployment failure*

=== Conditions on Locally Deployed Applications

image:logo-rtf-disabled.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies#anypoint-runtime-fabric", title="Runtime Fabric"]


On an application deployed to local servers, you can select any of these alert conditions:

* *Number of errors*
+
image::alerts-conditions-number-errors.png[Number of errors]
+
You must provide the number of errors that triggers the alert.
The time unit is per minute. An alarm is triggered when the error count goes over the threshold number in the timeslot of one minute.


* *Number of Mule messages*
+
image::alerts-conditions-number-mule-messages.png[Number of Mule messages]
+
You must provide the number of Mule messages, since the application was started, that trigger the alert.


* *Response time*
+
image::alerts-conditions-response-time.png[Response time]
+
You must provide the maximum accepted response time--anything over this value triggers the alert.


* *Application Deployment success*
* *Application Deployment failure*
* *Application undeployed*


=== Conditions on Servers

image:logo-cloud-disabled.png[link="/runtime-manager/deployment-strategies#cloudhub", title="CloudHub"]
