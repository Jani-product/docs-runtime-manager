CloudHub dedicated load balancers (DLBs) are an optional component of Anypoint Platform that enable you to route external HTTP and HTTPS traffic to multiple Mule applications deployed to CloudHub workers in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

Dedicated load balancers enable you to:

* Handle load balancing among the different CloudHub workers that run your application.
* Define SSL configurations to provide custom certificates and optionally enforce two-way SSL client authentication.
* Configure proxy rules that map your applications to custom domains.
+
This enables you to host your applications under a single domain.

To use a dedicated load balancer in your environment, you must first create an Anypoint VPC. Because you can associate multiple environments with the same Anypoint VPC, you can use the same dedicated load balancer for your different environments.

You can view the load balancer and Anypoint VPC endpoints in your Anypoint Platform organization from the API portal.

== Create and Configure a Dedicated Load Balancer

To create and configure a load balancer, you must be an administrator of the organization to which the load balancer is associated.

DLB names must be unique across all DLBs defined in Anypoint Platform (by all MuleSoft customers).

There are three ways to create and configure a dedicated load balancer for your Anypoint VPC:

* xref:lb-create-arm.adoc[Runtime Manager] from Anypoint Platform
* The xref:anypoint-platform-cli.adoc#cloudhub-load-balancer-create[cloudhub load-balancer create] command from the Anypoint Platform CLI
* The xref:cloudhub-api.adoc[CloudHub REST API] through these endpoints:
+
** `anypoint.mulesoft.com/cloudhub/api/organizations/{orgid}/loadbalancers`
** `anypoint.mulesoft.com/cloudhub/api/organizations/{orgid}/vpcs`

For a full description of `loadbalancers` and `vpcs` endpoints, see the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/cloudhub-api/[CloudHub API].

== Dedicated Load Balancer Licensing

Each DLB unit that you purchase is the equivalent of two workers handling load balancing between CloudHub workers.
You can assign up to four load balancer units to a DLB.
A DLB with four load balancer units assigned has eight workers.

== Static IP Addresses

If you enable static IP addresses for a DLB, the number of static IP addresses allocated to the DLB is equal to double the number of workers.
For example, if your DLB has four workers, the DLB has eight associated static IP addresses.

Half the static IPs (equal to the number of worker instances) are in use at any given time.
When you restart or update the DLB, the DLB switches to use the group of unused static IP addresses and transitions the first group of static IP addresses to the unused state.

Switching between the two groups of static IP addresses enables zero-downtime restarts and updates, ensuring that no transactions are dropped or lost as long as the transaction times are shorter than 600s or the value of *Mule Application Response Timeout* (whichever is smaller).

All newly created DLBs with static IP use this static IP model. 
Existing DLBs that use static IPs continue to use the original static IP addresses after restarting the DLB, unless you click the *Update* button.
After clicking *Update*, the DLB uses the new static IP model and you cannot revert to the old model.
The Runtime Manager *Load Balancers* page displays *Update Required* until you update the DLB:

.The arrow shows *Update Required* in the *Load Balancers* page.
