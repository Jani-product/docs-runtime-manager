CloudHub dedicated load balancers (DLBs) are an optional component of Anypoint Platform that enable you to route external HTTP and HTTPS traffic to multiple Mule applications deployed to CloudHub workers in a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

Dedicated load balancers enable you to:

* Handle load balancing among the different CloudHub workers that run your application.
* Define SSL configurations to provide custom certificates and optionally enforce two-way SSL client authentication.
* Configure proxy rules that map your applications to custom domains.
+
This enables you to host your applications under a single domain.

To use a dedicated load balancer in your environment, you must first create an Anypoint VPC. Because you can associate multiple environments with the same Anypoint VPC, you can use the same dedicated load balancer for your different environments.

You can view the load balancer and Anypoint VPC endpoints in your Anypoint Platform organization from the API portal.

== Create and Configure a Dedicated Load Balancer

To create and configure a load balancer, you must be an administrator of the organization to which the load balancer is associated.

DLB names must be unique across all DLBs defined in Anypoint Platform (by all MuleSoft customers).

There are three ways to create and configure a dedicated load balancer for your Anypoint VPC:

* xref:lb-create-arm.adoc[Runtime Manager] from Anypoint Platform
* The xref:anypoint-platform-cli.adoc#cloudhub-load-balancer-create[cloudhub load-balancer create] command from the Anypoint Platform CLI
* The xref:cloudhub-api.adoc[CloudHub REST API] through these endpoints:
+
** `anypoint.mulesoft.com/cloudhub/api/organizations/{orgid}/loadbalancers`
** `anypoint.mulesoft.com/cloudhub/api/organizations/{orgid}/vpcs`

For a full description of `loadbalancers` and `vpcs` endpoints, see the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/cloudhub-api/[CloudHub API].

== Dedicated Load Balancer Licensing

Each DLB unit that you purchase is the equivalent of two workers handling load balancing between CloudHub workers.
You can assign up to four load balancer units to a DLB.
A DLB with four load balancer units assigned has eight workers.

== Static IP Addresses
If a DLB has static IPs enabled, it will have double the number of static IPs allocated for this DLB. For example, if your DLB has 4 workers, the DLB will have 8 static IPs associated with it. Only half of these (equal to number of instances) will be in-use at any given time. If you restart or update your DLB, the unused group of static IPs will become in-use and the in-use will transition to an unused state.

This switch between the two groups of static IP addresses enables us to do a true zero-downtime restart or update of your DLBs, ensuring no transactions are dropped or lost (owing to the fact that the client respects the DLB's DNS TTL)

Note: Exisiting DLBs won't automatically start using the new static IPs until you opt-in using the UI at this point.
