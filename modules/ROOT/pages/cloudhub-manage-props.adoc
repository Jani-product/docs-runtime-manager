In a CloudHub deployment, you can add properties to an application using Anypoint Runtime Manager or the `mule-app.properties` file.

If you set properties both in `mule-app.properties` in your application and in Runtime Manager, the values set in Runtime Manager always override the values in `mule-app.properties` when your application deploys.


== Add Application Properties in Runtime Manager 

The easiest way to load properties to applications deployed to CloudHub is to use the *Properties* tab in Anypoint Runtime Manager.


To add properties: 

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager*.
. Click the *Applications* tab.
. Click the *Status* column to display the details pane.
. Click *Manage Application*.
. On the *Settings* page, click the *Properties* tab:
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the *Properties* tab, (*2*) the *List* button, (*3*) the key and value fields, and (*4*) the *X* icon on the application *Settings* page.

. Click *List*.
+
Alternatively, you can enter the key-value pair in the *Text* field in this format: `key=value`.
. Enter the property name in the key field.
. Enter the property value in the value field.
+
If the save password feature of Chrome is enabled and includes a username for `anypoint.mulesoft.com` that matches the contents of the key field, Chrome overwrites the value field with the stored password associated with that username. 
To work around this limitation, use Chrome in incognito mode or use another browser.
. If you want to change a key or value, edit the text in the field.
. If you want to delete a property, click *X*.
. Click *Apply Changes*.
. Select *Restart* from the menu in the top right to restart the application.



=== Example: Using Properties to Set Environment Variables 

You can specify Java system environment variables, which function the same as adding environment variables when you deploy to an on-premises server.

You can also configure environment variables for your application.
Properties enable you to externalize settings that change depending on the environment you're deploying to.
For example, if you use a Mule application locally, you might configure your database host to be `0.0.0.0`.
If you deploy the same app to CloudHub, you might configure the database host to be an Amazon RDS server.

To create set an environment variable using an application property:

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager*.
. Click the *Applications* tab.
. Click the *Status* column to display the details pane.
. Click *Manage Application*.
. On the *Settings* page, click the *Properties* tab:
. Define the variable by entering it in the *Text* view, in `key=value` format:
+
.The arrow shows the variable on the *Properties* tab of the application *Settings* page.

. Use the environment variable in your Mule app configuration:
+
[source,xml,linenums]

<spring:bean id="jdbcDataSource" class="org.enhydra.jdbc.standard.StandardDataSource" destroy-method="shutdown">
   <spring:property name="driverName" value="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"/>
   <spring:property name="url" value="${database.url}"/>
</spring:bean>

== Add Application Properties in the mule-app.properties File

You can add a `mule-app.properties` file inside the deployable application archive file. CloudHub then loads these properties into the application when the application starts. 

Although this method is not the best practice on CloudHub (because CloudHub *Properties* tab values override any with the same name in the file), you can work around this by changing options in the Mule app.


To prevent CloudHub properties from overriding properties bundled with the deployable archive, change options in the `Property Placeholder` element in the Mule application.
For more information about nondefault property placeholder options, see the https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/support/PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer.html[Spring documentation on Property Placeholder options].
