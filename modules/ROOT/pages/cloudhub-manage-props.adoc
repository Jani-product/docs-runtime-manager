In a CloudHub deployment, you can add properties to an application using Anypoint Runtime Manager or the `mule-app.properties` file.

== Add Application Properties in Runtime Manager 

The easiest way to load properties to applications deployed to CloudHub is to use the *Properties* tab in Anypoint Runtime Manager.
In the tab page, specify Java system environment variables, which function the same as adding environment variables when you deploy to an on-premises server.

To add properties: 

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager*.
. Click the *Applications* tab.
. Click the *Status* column to display the details pane.
. Click *Manage Application*.
. On the *Settings* page, click the *Properties* tab:

. Enter the property name in the *Key* field.
. Enter the property value in the *Value* field.
. Click *Save*, and then *Redeploy Application*.

You can edit or delete a property using options in the *...* menu.

== Add Application Properties with the mule-app.properties file

You can add a `mule-app.properties` file inside the deployable application archive file. CloudHub then loads these properties into the application when the application starts. 

Although this method is not the best practice on CloudHub (because CloudHub *Properties* tab values override any with the same name in the file), you can work around this by changing options in the Mule app.


To prevent CloudHub properties from overriding properties bundled with the deployable archive, change options in the `Property Placeholder` element in the Mule application. See https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/support/PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer.html[Spring documentation on Property Placeholder options] for more information about nondefault property placeholder options.

You can also flag application properties as safely hidden so that their values are not visible to users at runtime or passed between the server and the console.
