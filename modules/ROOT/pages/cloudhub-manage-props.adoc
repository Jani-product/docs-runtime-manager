In a CloudHub deployment, you can add properties to an application using Anypoint Runtime Manager or the `mule-app.properties` file.

If you set properties both in `mule-app.properties` in your application and in Runtime Manager, the values set in Runtime Manager always override the values in `mule-app.properties` when your application deploys.


== Add Application Properties in Runtime Manager 

The easiest way to load properties to applications deployed to CloudHub is to use the *Properties* tab in Anypoint Runtime Manager.


To add properties: 

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager*.
. Click the *Applications* tab.
. Click the *Status* column to display the details pane.
. Click *Manage Application*.
. On the *Settings* page, click the *Properties* tab:
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the *Properties* tab, (*2*) the *Key* and *Value* fields, and (*3*) the *...* menu on the application *Settings* page.

. Enter the property name in the *Key* field.
. Enter the property value in the *Value* field.
+
If the password autofill feature of Chrome is enabled and includes a username for anypoint.mulesoft.com that matches a variable you are creating, Chrome overwrites the configured value with the stored password for the username that matches the variable. 
To work around this limitation, use Chrome in incognito mode or another browser.

. Click *Apply Changes*.
. Select *Restart* to redeploy the application.

To change a key or value, edit the text in the field. To delete a property, click the *X*.


=== Example: Using Properties to Set Environment Variables 

You can specify Java system environment variables, which function the same as adding environment variables when you deploy to an on-premises server.

You can also configure environment variables for your application.
Properties enable you to externalize settings that change depending on the environment you're deploying to.
For example, if you use a Mule application locally, you might configure your database host to be `0.0.0.0`.
If you deploy the same app to CloudHub, you might configure the database host to be an Amazon RDS server.

To create set an environment variable using an application property:

. Select the *Properties* tab in the *Settings* section. 
. Define the variable by entering it in the *Text* view as a `key=value` format:
+
.The arrow shows the variable on the *Properties* tab of the application *Settings* page.

. Use the environment variable in your Mule app configuration:
+
[source,xml,linenums]
----
<spring:bean id="jdbcDataSource" class="org.enhydra.jdbc.standard.StandardDataSource" destroy-method="shutdown">
   <spring:property name="driverName" value="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"/>
   <spring:property name="url" value="${database.url}"/>
</spring:bean>

== Add Application Properties with the mule-app.properties file

You can add a `mule-app.properties` file inside the deployable application archive file. CloudHub then loads these properties into the application when the application starts. 

Although this method is not the best practice on CloudHub (because CloudHub *Properties* tab values override any with the same name in the file), you can work around this by changing options in the Mule app.


To prevent CloudHub properties from overriding properties bundled with the deployable archive, change options in the `Property Placeholder` element in the Mule application. See https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/support/PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer.html[Spring documentation on Property Placeholder options] for more information about nondefault property placeholder options.
