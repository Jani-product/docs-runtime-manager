In a CloudHub deployment, there are several ways to add properties to an application. 

== Add Properties in Runtime Manager 

The easiest way to load properties on applications deployed to CloudHub is to use the *Properties* tab in Runtime Manager.
You specify Java system environment variables, which function the same as adding environment variables when you deploy to an on-premises server.

To add properties: 

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager*.
. Click the *Applications* tab.
. Click the *Status* column to display the details pane.
. Click *Manage Application*.
. On the *Settings* page, click the *Properties* tab:

.The screenshot shows (*1*) the *Properties* tab, (*2*) the *Key* and *Value* fields, and (*3*) the *...* menu on the application  *Settings* page.

. Enter the property name in the *Key* field.
. Enter the property value in the *Value* field.
. Click *Save*, and then *Redeploy Application*.
. You can edit or delete a property using options in the *...* menu.

== Manage Properties in mule-app.properties 

You can add a `mule-app.properties` file inside the deployable application archive file. CloudHub then loads these properties into the application when the application starts. This method isn't recommended on CloudHub because, when your application is deployed, entries in the CloudHub *Properties* tab override any other property with the same name defined in the bundled files within the application. 

You can change the behavior of the application to not allow CloudHub properties to override properties bundled with the deployable archive.
To do this, change options in the Property Placeholder element in the Mule application. See https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/support/PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer.html[Spring documentation on Property Placeholder options] for more information about non-default property placeholder options.

You can also flag application properties as secure so that their values are not visible to users at runtime or passed between the server and the console.
