The CloudHub REST API enables you to programmatically access these functions of Runtime Manager:

* Create an application on CloudHub.
* Change the application properties, including the number of workers and environment variables.
* Deploy a new version of your application.
* Delete your application.
* Get statistics about your application.
* Create CloudHub notifications.
* Create email alerts triggered by your applications.

For an interactive reference that includes supported resources, methods, required properties, and expected responses, see the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/cloudhub-api/[CloudHub API Portal].

The CloudHub API applies only to deployments to the cloud-based version of the Runtime Manager. To manage on-prem applications using an API, see the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform/anypoint-platform/#/portals/organizations/ae639f94-da46-42bc-9d51-180ec25cf994/apis/38784/versions/5567732[Runtime Manager API Portal].


== Getting Started and Authenticating with the API

Before getting started, familiarize yourself with Operations for Applications.

You can use any HTTP client with the CloudHub API. With Java, use the https://jersey.github.io/[Jersey client] or http://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/index.html[HttpClient] with https://github.com/codehaus/jackson[Jackson] for JSON support.

To access the CloudHub API, first, authenticate with Anypoint Platform. To authenticate, use the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/access-management-api/[Access Management API]. Authentication requires that you supply an access token in the Authorization header. See https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform/anypoint-platform/#/portals/organizations/68ef9520-24e9-4cf2-b2f5-620025690913/apis/11270/versions/11646/pages/60046[Authentication] for information.

Your username specifies the environment to access and is in the form "user@environment". For example, if your username is "jane" and the environment is "Development", your username is `jane@Development`. If you don't specify an environment, the API defaults to the Production environment.


== Data Format

Resources and methods that return or accept a type use the JSON data format. Here is an example of data received in JSON format in response to a request to get an application:

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
  "domain":"hello",
  "fullDomain":"hello.cloudhub.io",
  "workers":1,
  "hasFile":false,
  "muleVersion": "3.1.2",
  "properties": {
    "foo":"bar"
  },
  "status":"STARTED",
  "workerStatuses":[
     {
       "id":"",
       "host":"xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx",
       "port":8081,
       "status":"STARTED"
     }
   ]
}
----


== Status Codes and Error Handling

When you call the REST APIs, the following status codes are returned:

[%header,cols="10a,50a"]
|===
|Status Code |Description
|200 |The operation was successful.
|201 |The resource (such as an application) was created.

The Location header contains the location of the resource.
|404 |The resource was not found.
|409 |When creating a resource (such as a server, server group, or deployment), a resource with that name already exists.
|500 |The operation was unsuccessful.

See the HTTP body for details.
|===

When errors occur (such as a 500 status code), the HTTP response contains a JSON response with an error message. For example:

[source,json,linenums]
----
500
Content-Type: application/json
Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1
Date: Mon, 10 Aug 2015 00:12:55 GMT

{
  message : "Some error message."
}
----
