To ensure your applications and related operations are tolerant to Anypoint VPN updates, issues, or individual Customer Gateway failures, implement High Availability VPN connections.

Each Anypoint VPN connection consists of two endpoints, providing High Availability (HA) on the MuleSoft side by default.

== Prerequisites

* Sufficient entitlement for each VPN connection.
* Two VPN endpoints using different public IP addresses.
* Two VPN connections in Runtime Manager.

== Configure High Availability with Anypoint VPN

The example below shows a High Availability VPN topology using a single MuleSoft VPC and two VPN connections.

A MuleSoft Virtual Private Gateway (VGW) can only be associated with a single MuleSoft VPC, but it supports up to 10 VPN connections.
You can locate your VPN Gateways in the same data center, or in different physical locations.

 Use BGP routing to advertise the same routes via VPN-1 and VPN-2. See https://help.mulesoft.com/s/article/Anypoint-VPN-Path-Selection-using-BGP-Routing[Anypoint VPN Path Selection using BGP Routing] for instructions on how to control path selection via the routing protocol.

 In this scenario, the VPN Gateways are configured to prefer: VPN-1 Tunnel-1, then VPN-1 Tunnel-2, then VPN-2 Tunnel-1, and finally VPN-2 Tunnel-2.
 This allows you to make use of automatic failover to another tunnel, and to another VPN in the event of a VPN connectivity issue. This makes the Anypoint VPN solution more resilient and robust.

You can also configure a High Availability VPN connection using static routing. In this scenario, you can manually establish VPN-2 to work as a redundant, standby connection in the event of a failure with VPN-1. There is no automatic failover between the VPNs.
