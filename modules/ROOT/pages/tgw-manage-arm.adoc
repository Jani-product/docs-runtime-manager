. At the confirmation prompt, click *Remove*.

== Detach an Anypoint VPC from the Transit Gateway

Because detaching a VPC from a transit gateway also deletes the attachment in AWS,
undeploy any apps deployed to the VPC before detaching the VPC.

To detach a VPC from the transit gateway:

. On the *Transit Gateways* page, click the VPC menu (*...*) and select *Detach*.
+
_update screenshot - content and styles changed_
+

. At the confirmation prompt, click *Detach*.
+
Detaching a VPC might take several minutes.
+
After the VPC is detached, the *Attach VPC* button becomes available. 

== Remove an Anypoint VPC from the Transit Gateway

If AWS rejects the attachment, remove it before trying to attach it again.

To remove a VPC from the transit gateway:

. On the *Transit Gateways* page, click the VPC menu (*...*) and select *Remove*.
+
_new screenshot_
+
// image::tgw-remove-vpc.png[Remove VPC option in the VPC menu]
. At the confirmation prompt, click *Remove*.
+
Removing a VPC might take several minutes.
+
After the VPC is removed, the *Attach VPC* button becomes available. 

== Remove a Transit Gateway from Anypoint Platform

If a transit gateway has no VPCs attached, you can remove it from Anypoint Platform. 

[NOTE]
Removing a transit gateway deletes the resource share in AWS that Anypoint Platform uses to access the transit gateway.

To remove a transit gateway from Anypoint Platform:

. On the *Transit Gateways* page, click the Transit Gateway menu (*...*) and select *Remove*:
+
_update screenshot - content and styles changed_
+
image::tgw-remove.png[Remove option in the Transit Gateway menu]
+
Anypoint Platform prevents you from removing a transit gateway if it has VPCs attached.
+
If the *Transit Gateways* page doesn't list any VPCs, but you can't delete the transit gateway, the transit gateway might be attached to a VPC that belongs to another business group that you don't have access to.
. At the confirmation prompt, click *Remove*.
