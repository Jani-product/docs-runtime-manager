You can deploy a Mule application to a local server using:

* xref:deployment-strategies.adoc#cloud-console-on-premises-deployment[Anypoint Platform Runtime Manager cloud console]
* xref:deployment-strategies.adoc#on-premises-console-on-premises-deployment[Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition Runtime Manager console]
* https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/arm-rest-services[Runtime Manager API]
* xref:mule-runtime::deploy-on-premises.adoc[Mule Maven plugin]


When you use Runtime Manager to manage a server, you cannot use other deployment and management methods or tools to manage the server.

[NOTE] The application file size limit is 200 MB.


== Prerequisites

Before you can deploy to a local server, you must first:

. xref:mule-runtime::runtime-installation-task.adoc[Download and install Mule].
. xref:servers-create.adoc[Add a server to Runtime Manager].



== Deploy an Application from Runtime Manager

If you created an application in a sandbox environment and tested it, you probably will eventually want to migrate it to production.

Also, be mindful of the Mule versions being used by the servers in both environments. They should both use the same or compatible versions. 



To deploy an app to your local server from Runtime Manager:

. Sign in to Anypoint Platform.
. Select *Runtime Manager*.
. Click *Deploy application*.
. Provide a name for your application.
+
The application name identifies your application in Runtime Manager and must be unique.
Valid names contain alphanumeric characters and dashes, and contain at most 40 characters.
If the name is valid, Runtime Manager alerts you if it is already in use.

. Select the deployment target.
+
The target must be a running server, server group, or cluster.
+
For more information about deploying to CloudHub, see xref:deploying-to-cloudhub.adoc[Deploying to CloudHub].

. Click *Choose file*, then select an option from the menu:
+
--
*Import file from Exchange*
+
.. Select *Application* for the type.
.. Enter the name of your application in the search box.
+
Your application appears in the search results list.
.. Select the application to deploy, select a version from the *Version* menu, and then click *Select*.
--
*Upload file*
+
Select the file to upload and click *Open*.
*Get from sandbox* 

You can also click the *Get from sandbox* button to copy a file from a non-production environment into your current environment. If the *Get From Sandbox* button does not appear, you may first need to create a non-production environment to view this option.


.. Select the environment, such as Sandbox, to get the application from.
.. If necessary, search for the application to deploy.
.. Select the application to deploy and then click *Apply*.
+
Only applications that are deployed to user-managed runtimes are displayed in this list.
Applications deployed to CloudHub workers that are in sandbox environments can only be promoted to run on other CloudHub workers.
. Configure application options:

* Deployment Target 
* Insight 
+
The Insight tab lets you specify metadata options for the Insight analytics feature. For more information, see xref:insight.adoc[Insight].

* Properties 
* Logging 

. Click *Deploy Application*.

The new application appears in the list of deployed applications in the Applications tab.


==== Limitations

* If you're deploying to a production target that is of a different type (cluster, single server) or that has a different Mule version installed in it, there could be compatibility issues.
* Only a user with permissions on both the sandbox environment and the destination production environment can move applications between them.
* To avoid domain name conflict, an application cannot exist in two environments at the same time. Alter the application's name slightly to deploy it to another environment.
* Runtime Manager prevents you from having duplicate application names in a single environment. If a name is already taken, you are prompted to provide a new name.



=== Runtime Version

Since the server, server group or cluster you select implicitly has a single Mule version installed, this is determined automatically by the server you select.

Keep in mind that servers in a cluster must have the same Mule version installed in all of them.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ensure that the Mule version in the server or servers is the same version used to develop your application. For example, if you deploy to a server that runs Mule 3.5.0 and your application uses the new HTTP connector introduced in Mule 3.6 and newer, your application won't deploy and the log contains errors.
====

== Properties Tab

The Properties tab enables you to specify properties that the application uses during deployment and while running. Application properties are defined as key/value pairs.

image::deploy-app-properties-tab.png[]

For example, you can define properties for `db_user` and `db_password` that specify credentials for connecting to a database.

Specifying properties in Runtime Manager enables you to define properties in one place rather than having multiple application property files for a single application in multiple environments. You can also define application-specific properties in a properties file, then later add environment-specific properties from Runtime Manager during deployment

After deploying an application, you can modify application properties or create new ones from the Application Settings page. The values of properties defined on this tab override any application properties defined in the `mule-app.properties` or other properties of Mule.

If you change properties after an application is deployed, you must restart the application and any server group or cluster where the application is deployed.

When deploying an application using the Get From Sandbox feature, your new application will inherit any properties defined in the original application. You can update these properties as required before deploying the application.

The following security considerations apply to these properties:

* Values sent between Runtime Manager and Mule are encrypted over HTTPS.
* Values stored in the Runtime Manager internal database are encrypted.
* By default, Runtime Manager does not display the values of the properties in the UI.
* Only users that have access to the Application Setting page can view these properties.

== Logging Tab

Each Mule stores log files in its respective local drive. The Logging tab of the deploy menu lets you configure how these logs are structured. Specifically, it lets you set how the different logging levels are applied (`INFO`, `DEBUG`, `WARN`, or `ERROR`), so that they don't follow the default usage.

[TIP]
Configuring this via the logging tab has the same effects as editing the `log4j2.xml` file on Mule. For details on how to do that, see
see xref:3.8@mule-runtime::logging-in-mule.adoc#configuring-custom-logging-settings[logging in Mule]. You can also check a reference to  https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html[`log4j2.xml` configuration] in Apache's documentation.



== Configuring a Deployed Application

You can change the application file of a deployed application:

. Select your application in the *Applications* page to open its corresponding panel.
. Click *Choose File* to upload a new file.

[TIP]
Keep in mind that your application will experience a moment of downtime while the new version you just selected is launched in the server, server group, or cluster.


== Deployment Errors

If an error occurs and the application cannot be deployed, the application status indicator changes to `Failed`. You are alerted in the status area that an error occurred. Check the log details for any application deployment errors. You need to correct the error, upload the application, and deploy again.
