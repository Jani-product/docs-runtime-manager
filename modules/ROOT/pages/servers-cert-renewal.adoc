Registering a Mule server in Runtime Manager requires a valid certificate provisioned and signed by Runtime Manager. The certificate ensures secure communications between Runtime Manager and the Runtime Manager agent. 

However, certificates expire, and you cannot renew them after they expire. Before a certificate expires, renew it directly from Runtime Manager. You can see the expiration date on the server dashboard.

A server must be running for you to update its certificate. You can update a certificate for a specific server or multiple servers within a cluster or group.


To renew a certificate for a server:

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager*.
. Click the *Servers* tab.
. Verify that the server status is Running.
. Click the server name.
. Click *Settings*.
. From the *Actions* menu, select *Renew Certificate*.
. Click the checkbox to confirm your choice, and then click *Renew*.
. Check *Certificate expiration date* to confirm that the certificate was successfully renewed:

.The arrow shows the *Certificate expiration date* on the *Settings* page.
