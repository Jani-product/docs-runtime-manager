When registering a Mule server in Runtime Manager, you must supply a certificate to ensure secure communications between Runtime Manager and the Runtime Manager agent. When the certificate expires, you can renew it directly from Runtime Manager. You can update a certificate for a specific server or multiple servers within a cluster or group.

You can view the expiration date of the certificate in the server dashboard. 

To renew a certificate for a server:

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager*.
. Click the *Servers* tab.
. Verify that the server status is *Running*.
+
The server must be running to renew the certificate.
. Click the server name.
. Click *Settings*.
. From the *Actions* drop-down list, select *Renew Certificate*.
. Click the checkbox to confirm, then click *Renew*.
. Check *Certificate expiration date* to confirm that the certificate was successfully renewed.
+
.The arrow shows the *Certificate expiration date* on the *Settings* page.
