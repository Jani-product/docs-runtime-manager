To deploy applications to server groups, first create the servers, then create the server group. You can add servers to server groups when you create the group or you can add them later.

To create a server group:

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager*.
. In Runtime Manager, click *Servers* in the left menu.
. Click the *Create Group* button.
. In the *Create Server Group* page, enter the name for the server group, select the servers to include in your new server group, and click *Create Group*.
+
Group names can contain between 3-40 alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and hyphens (-). They cannot start or end with a hyphen and cannot contain spaces or other characters.

The new server group appears in the *Servers* list. To see the list of servers in the group, click the server group name.
