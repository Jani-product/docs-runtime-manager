In an on-premises (hybrid or Anypoint Platform PCE) deployment, you can add properties to an application using the `mule-app.properties` file or Anypoint Runtime Manager.

== Add Application Properties with the mule-app.properties file

The most common method to add properties to an app is to include a `mule-app.properties` file containing the properties in the application .zip bundle.

Mule runtime engine then loads these properties into the application when the application starts.
 

== Add Application Properties in Runtime Manager 

You can override the property values in the `mule-app.properties` file bundled inside the application in Runtime Manager:

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager*.
. Click the *Applications* tab.
. Click the *Status* column to display the details pane.
. Click *Manage Application*.
. On the *Settings* page, click the *Properties* tab:
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the *Properties* tab, (*2*) the *Key* and *Value* fields, and (*3*) the *...* menu on the application  *Settings* page.

. Enter the property name in the *Key* field.
. Enter the property value in the *Value* field.
. Click *Save*, and then *Redeploy Application*.

You can edit or delete a property using options in the *...* menu.


== Other Methods for Overriding App Properties

The following are some alternative methods for overriding app properties:

* Configure an external location to add property placeholders or secure property placeholder files to override properties.

* Set Java system environment variables at deployment time to override properties.
+
To do this, deploy the app using the following command:
+
----
mule -M-Dsecret.key=toSecretPassword -M-Denv=prod -M-Ddb.password=secretPassword -app myApp.zip
----
+
In this case, all the values typed into the command are stored only in memory and must be provided every time. The values are never stored in any file.
