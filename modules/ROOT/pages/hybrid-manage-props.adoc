In an on-premises deployment, there are several ways to add properties to an application: 

The most common method is to include a `mule-app.properties` file containing the properties in the application .zip bundle. The Mule runtime engine then loads these properties into the application when the application starts.

Alternatively, you can override the property values in this file bundled inside the application in one of these ways:

* Configure an external location to add property placeholders or secure property placeholder files to override properties.

* Set Java system environment variables at deployment time to override properties.
+
In this case, you deploy the app using the following command:

----
mule -M-Dsecret.key=toSecretPassword -M-Denv=prod -M-Ddb.password=secretPassword -app myApp.zip
----

In this case, all the values typed into the command are stored only in memory and must be provided every time. The values are never stored in any file.
