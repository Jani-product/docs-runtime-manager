To manually delete a gateway and its replicas in Runtime Manager:

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager*.
. Select *Flex Gateway* in the left menu.
. Click the action menu button for the gateway you want to unregister.
. Click *Delete gateway*.

[NOTE]
Replicas are automatically unregistered after a period of inactivity of 10 minutes.

Deleting a gateway from the Runtime Manager UI simply removes the connection between Anypoint Platform and the gateway and all its replicas. This action does not uninstall the gateway from the server.

[NOTE]
If you unregister a gateway, you lose all its configuration history and will not be able to restore it when you re-register the gateway later.
