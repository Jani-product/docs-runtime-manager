For the majority of use cases, all you'll need to do with the Runtime Manager Agent is install it and configure it according to what you can read in xref:installing-and-configuring-runtime-manager-agent.adoc[Installing and Configuring the Runtime Manager Agent]

To use the Runtime Manager Agent for more than managing the communication between the xref:index.adoc[Runtime Manager] and Runtimes on-premises, then you may find the documents in this section helpful:

* xref:administration-service.adoc[Administration Service]
* xref:managing-applications-and-domains.adoc[Managing Applications and Domains]
* xref:jmx-service.adoc[JMX Service]
* xref:runtime-manager-agent-notifications.adoc[Runtime Manager Agent Notifications]


[NOTE]
None of these topics relate to the xref:3.8@mule-management-console::index.adoc[Mule Management Console]. These topics are about the Runtime Manager Agent that communicates with Runtime Manager with local runtimes.
