For the majority of use cases, all you'll need to do is install and configure the Runtime Manager agent using xref:installing-and-configuring-runtime-manager-agent.adoc[Install or Update the Runtime Manager agent]

To use the Runtime Manager agent for more than managing the communication between xref:index.adoc[Runtime Manager] and Runtime Manager on-premises, you might find the documents in this section helpful:

* xref:administration-service.adoc[Administration Service]
* xref:managing-applications-and-domains.adoc[Managing Applications and Domains]
* xref:jmx-service.adoc[JMX Service]
* xref:runtime-manager-agent-notifications.adoc[Runtime Manager Agent Notifications]


[NOTE]
None of these topics relate to the xref:3.8@mule-management-console::index.adoc[Mule Management Console]. These topics are about the Runtime Manager agent that communicates with Runtime Manager with local runtimes.
