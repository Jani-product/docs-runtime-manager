The CloudHub dedicated load balancer (DLB) routes requests from clients to Mule apps deployed within the VPC.
Mapping rules enable you to rename requests to the DLB (input URL) to a different Mule application domain name.

Mapping rules are attributes of the load balancer's SSL endpoint, which is identified by the certificate Common Name (CN).

When you create a mapping rule with the CLI, you must specify a certificate CN.
If you omit the `[certificateName]` parameter, the mappings are added to the default endpoint.

When you create a simple matching rule, one input address is matched to the defined output: the endpoint of one of your applications.
Instead of using literal matchings, you can also use a pattern to match a variable, such as input text to an endpoint.

By using proxy rules, you can map a domain or subdomain to one of your Mule applications running in CloudHub.


mapping rules, yes… so in the most basic terms the customer calls <DLB>/<app>/<some path>, and mapping rules change it to <app>/<some path>


== Create Mapping Rules

To create a mapping rule in a DLB's certificate:

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager*.
. Select *Load Balancers* in the left menu.
. Click a load balancer name, then click a certificate name.
. In the *URL Mapping Rules* section, click *Add New Rule*.
+
.The screenshot shows (*1*) the *Add New Rule* icon and (*2*) the fields required to create a mapping rule.
image::cloudhub-dlb-mapping-rules.png[the *Add New Rule* icon and the fields required to create a mapping rule]
. Complete the fields:
+
* Input Path
* Target App
+
The name of the application where the request is forwarded. 
* Output Path 
* Protocol 
+
The protocol: HTTP, HTTPS, ws (WebSockets), or wss (Web Service Security)


You can use literal strings or patterns to define both input and output URLs.

The order of the rules determines the priority. The first rule in the list that matches is applied. 


If your SSL endpoint sets a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_certificate[wildcard certificate], and you want to use the subdomain portion in a mapping rule, you can use the pre-defined `{subdomain}` variable.



== Using Patterns in Mapping Rules

[IMPORTANT]
Patterns in the application URI are not currently supported.

A pattern is a string that defines a template for matching an input text. The value in curly brackets (`{   }`) is treated as a variable.

* Variable names can contain only lowercase letters (a-z) and no other characters.
* Variable values can contain the characters `a-z0-1.&?-_`, but can't contain slashes.

Suppose you set up a DNS CNAME record from  `example.com` to `_lb-name_.lb.anypointdns.net`. You can then map `app.example.com` to a different deployed CloudHub Mule application name.

For example, you can bind two hostnames for redirect:

[source,text,linenums]
----
‘app.example.com’ ->  application: `app` URI: `/example’
----

In this case, external requests to `+https://app.example.com+` are directed to `+http://app.cloudhub.io/example+`.

Or you can define a pattern to hold the input value:

[source,text,linenums]
----
‘example.com/{mypattern}’ -> application: `app-{mypattern}` URI: /data
----

The example above causes that both `example.com/bookings` and `example.com/sales` match to `app-bookings/data` and `app-sales/data` respectively, as the variable `_mypattern_` holds these values.
For `input=”bookings.example.com”`, the pattern can be resolved by assigning `_mypattern_=”bookings”` and for `input=`sales.example.com``, the pattern is resolved to assign `_mypattern_=”sales”`.

Depending on your design, you can leverage your internal redirects to your endpoints by using either patterns or literal mappings.



== Mapping Rule Examples

The external load balancer domain name depends on the unique name you assign to it. In the following mapping rule examples, the load balancer is `lb-demo`.

By default, your load balancer listens to external requests on HTTPS and communicates internally with your worker over HTTP.
If you configured your Mule application within the VPC to listen on HTTPS, make sure you set `upstreamProtocol` to `HTTPS` when creating the mapping list using the `load-balancer mappings add` command.

=== URL Mapping

You can pass the app name as an input URI and map it directly to the app name in CloudHub:

[%header,cols="10a,20a,20a,10a"]
|===
|Rule # |Input URL 2+^| Output URL
|   |    *URI*   |       *appName*   |   *appURI*
| 0 | /{app}/    | {app}             | /
|===

This rule maps `lb-demo.lb.anypointdns.net/{app}` to `{app}.cloudhub.io`. `{app}` is a pattern for any application name you pass in the inbound request.


=== Host Mapping

If you have a wildcard certificate (such as `*.example.com`), you can use the `subdomain` variable to map any subdomain:

[%header,cols="10a,20a,20a,10a"]
|===
|Rule # |Input URL 2+^| Output URL
|   |  *URI*   |       *appName*    |  *appURI*
| 0 | /        | {subdomain}   | /
|===
This rule automatically maps any request passed to a subdomain of `example.com` to the corresponding `appName`. For example:

* Passing `api.example.com` would redirect to `api.cloudhub.io` +
* Passing `application.example.com` is mapped to `application.cloudhub.io`.

The same applies to the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject_Alternative_Name[Subject Alternative Names] (SANs) of your SSL endpoints.

Instead of using a wildcard certificate, which permits any subdomain application name to be passed through the dedicated load balancer, you can restrict the allowed subdomain names. To do this, you must have different SANs configured for a certificate's common name. You can use the `subdomain` variable to map the subdomain portion of your domain name to your application.

In this example:

* Two deployed applications:
** `dev-app`
** `qa-app`
* An SSL endpoint with the SANs:
** `dev.example.com`
** `qa.example.com`
* Mapping rule:
+
[%header,cols="10a,20a,20a,10a"]
|===
|Rule # |Input URL 2+^| Output URL
|   |  *URI*   |       *appName*    |  *appURI*
| 0 | /        | {subdomain}-app   | /
|===

This rule maps the subdomain part of your domain name to the application name:

* `dev.example.com` redirects to `dev-app.cloudhub.io`.
* `qa.example.com` redirects to `qa-app.cloudhub.io`.


=== 1:1 Mapping

If you have only one application, you can map the literal app name.

[%header,cols="10a,20a,20a,10a"]
|===
|Rule # |Input URL 2+^| Output URL
|   |  *URI*  |   *appName* |   *appURI*
| 0 | /       |    myApp    | /
|===
This maps your default load balancer `lb-demo.lb.anypointdns.net` directly to your app in CloudHub `myApp.cloudhub.io`.

== Indexing the Priority of Rules

When creating a mapping rule, assign an index to it to define the rule's priority order.

A rule defined first, at index `0` has higher priority against other rules defined after it. The higher the index assigned, the less priority the mapping rule has.

Every rule must have a priority defined. When creating rules, pay attention to the order for each rule to avoid having multiple rules override each other.

=== Ordering and Prioritizing Rules

You can set the order of your mapping rules when creating them using the xref:anypoint-platform-cli-commands.adoc#cloudhub-load-balancer-mappings-add[cloudhub load-balancer mappings add] command in the Anypoint Platform CLI and specifying an index value.

When using the API to create a rule, you cannot specify a priority order, but you can send a `PATCH` request later to the load balancer endpoint `anypoint.mulesoft.com/cloudhub/api/organizations/{orgid}/loadbalancers/{loadbalancerId}` and update your rules expressions with an order index, to match your needs based on the order logic explained above.

The load balancer ID is provided to you when you create the load balancer. You can also perform a `GET` request to your endpoint `/organizations/{orgid}}/loadbalancers` to get the ID.
