To ensure the security of CloudHub and your applications, MuleSoft releases service pack updates
(_date patch_).
These updates contain only backward-compatible bug fixes and security patches to address vulnerabilities discovered in Mule runtime engine, JVM, and the underlying operating system.

When an update is available, the date patch appears in the *Runtime version* menu in the *Settings* page for the application:

.The arrow shows the date patch version in the *Runtime version* menu.

To keep your apps up-to-date and secure, apply the latest date patch version updates when they become available.
See xref:cloudhub-app-runtime-version-updates.adoc[Updating the Runtime Version for CloudHub Apps].

== Automatic Updates 

To adhere to Salesforce Security SLAs, CloudHub automatically updates your application runtime
to the latest date patch version at least once a month.


Also, MuleSoft regularly runs scans to identify security vulnerabilities.
For identified security issues, MuleSoft adheres to the following SLAs:

[%header,cols="3"]
|===
|Severity Level | Severity Definition | SLA 
|P0 | Critical | 7 days
|P1 | High | 30 days
|P2 | Medium | 90 days
|P3 | Low | 120 days
|===


Your audit log contains an entry by user `Anypoint Staff`, which shows the date and time an update occurred and whether it was successful.

The updates use blue-green deployment, which ensures zero downtime.

If the update is successful, no action is required.

== Zero-Downtime Restart Limitations

Zero-downtime restarts don't work in the following cases:

* The CloudHub application is a durable subscriber.
+
In this case, only one unique subscriber can be active at a time. 
For these applications, you must manually stop and start the application to take the latest update.

* The CloudHub application connects to an external dependency that is unavailable, unresponsive, or requires warmup.
+
In this case, CloudHub waits for up to 3 minutes for the application to connect with any post-startup dependencies before moving the application domain and related static IP addresses (if used) to the new version of the application.

If either case applies to your applications, contact Support and your CSM for information about updating the application to be cloud-ready.
