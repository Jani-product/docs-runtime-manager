http://www.mulesoft.com/cloudhub/ipaas-cloud-based-integration-demand[CloudHub] is an integration platform as a service (iPaaS). Through the xref:index.adoc[Runtime Manager], it allows you to deploy sophisticated cross-cloud integration applications in the cloud, create new APIs on top of existing data sources, integrate on-premises applications with cloud services, and much more. 

You can deploy applications using the xref:index.adoc[Runtime Manager] console, or you can xref:deploying-to-your-own-servers.adoc[deploy] to xref:managing-servers.adoc[servers, server groups, and clusters] on-premises.

== Create an Application for CloudHub

image::logo-app.png[app]

* See xref:runtime-manager:deploying-to-cloudhub.adoc[Deploying to CloudHub].
* See xref:building-an-https-service.adoc[Building an HTTPS Service on CloudHub] include HTTPS support in this application.

[TIP]
For examples of more applications, see xref:exchange::index.adoc[Anypoint Exchange].

You can deploy the same Mule applications to CloudHub or to an xref:deploying-to-your-own-servers.adoc[on-premises server]. There are xref:deployment-strategies.adoc[some considerations] about how features work between both types of environments when you plan your deployment strategy. See xref:deployment-strategies.adoc[Deployment Strategies].

== Deploy your Application to CloudHub

image::logo-deploy.png[deploy]

Learn how you can deploy your applications to CloudHub:

* xref:deploying-to-cloudhub.adoc[Deploying to CloudHub]
* If you prefer, you can also use the xref:anypoint-platform-cli.adoc[Anypoint Platform Command Line Interface (Anypoint Platform CLI)] to deploy and manage your application

[TIP]
If you prefer, the same Runtime Manager console also enables you to xref:deploying-to-your-own-servers.adoc[deploy] and manage applications to your own servers.


=== Easy Scalability

CloudHub is an elastic cloud, meaning it scales on demand. You can start small and scale up as your needs grow, without changing your applications or experiencing downtime. CloudHub provides a scalable architecture â€“ one on which you can build integration applications, publish REST APIs, or Web services, and much more.
////

With the xref:autoscaling-in-cloudhub.adoc[Autoscaling] feature, you can give your apps access to a varying amount of processing resources depending on how much they have been using, and you can define the rules and thresholds for triggering automatic changes.
////



=== Integration with Anypoint Studio

With xref:6@studio::index.adoc[Anypoint Studio (Studio)] you can quickly build integration applications and deploy to CloudHub with just a few clicks, without even leaving Studio. See xref:deploying-to-cloudhub.adoc#from-anypoint-platform[Deploying to CloudHub] for more information.

Once your application is deployed to CloudHub's multi-tenant runtime, access it like any other application deployed through the platform, by http://anypoint.mulesoft.com[logging in] to the Anypoint Platform, and then going to the Runtime Manager.

=== Integrate Cloud and Enterprise Applications

The CloudHub xref:virtual-private-cloud.adoc[Anypoint Virtual Private Cloud (Anypoint VPC)] allows you to construct a secure pipe to on-premise applications through an IPsec VPN tunnel, Anypoint VPC peering or direct connection.

=== CloudHub API

To automate tasks or automatically deploy to CloudHub, use the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/cloudhub-api[CloudHub REST API]. This enables you to perform tasks such as manage and monitor your applications, scale your applications, etc.

== Manage your Application

image::logo-manage.png[manage]

Learn how you can manage an application that is currently running in CloudHub:

* xref:managing-deployed-applications.adoc[Manage Deployed Applications] deals with settings that are general to all applications, both those deployed to CloudHub and to on-premise servers.
* xref:managing-applications-on-cloudhub.adoc[Manage Applications on CloudHub] deals with settings specific to applications on CloudHub.

=== Visibility and Control through Runtime Manager

You handle your applications on CloudHub through the xref:index.adoc[Runtime Manager], an intuitive cloud console where you can xref:managing-deployed-applications.adoc[manage] and xref:monitoring.adoc[monitor] every aspect of your applications, all from one place. In addition to that, through the same Runtime Manager console you can xref:managing-servers.adoc[manage] your on-premise servers, server groups, and clusters, as well as any xref:managing-deployed-applications.adoc[applications deployed to them], giving you a single management pane of glass for all your applications and servers.


See:

* xref:managing-deployed-applications.adoc[Managing Deployed Applications] for an overview on what you can do with applications in general on the Runtime Manager
* xref:managing-applications-on-cloudhub.adoc[Managing Applications on CloudHub] for an overview on what you can do specifically with applications on the Runtime Manager


[NOTE]
You can view the live status and detailed service history for the Runtime Manager console, platform services, and the CloudHub worker cloud on http://trust.mulesoft.com/[`trust.mulesoft.com`].


== Monitor your Application

image::logo-monitor.png[monitor]

Through various tools, Runtime Manager allows you to triage problems, view logs, set up alerts, view dashboards, and more. See xref:monitoring.adoc[Monitoring Applications] for an overview on the different ways that the Runtime Manager allows you to monitor your running applications.
