[TIP]
This document deals with calling the xref:cloudhub-api.adoc[CloudHub API]. For instructions on how to perform these same tasks more easily via the Runtime Manager UI, see xref:cloudhub.adoc[CloudHub] and its child pages.

The PUT operation specified with the `/api/notifications/{id}` resource updates a notification. Currently, the only update that can be applied is marking a notification as read.
