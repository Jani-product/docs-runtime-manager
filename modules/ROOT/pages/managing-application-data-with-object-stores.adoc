CloudHub includes application data storage for each application it manages, this data is accessible through Mule's xref:3.8@mule-runtime::mule-object-stores.adoc[Object Store v1] and xref:object-store::index.adoc[Object Store v2] functionality. Object Stores can be used to store anything, but two of its main uses are:

* Storing synchronization state:  Your application may need to keep track of the last synchronized record, so that the next time the application synchronizes, it can resume where it left off.
* OAuth tokens: OAuth enabled connectors can store tokens inside an Object Store with a few lines of configuration code.

Your application can also store custom integration data as well, within the limits outlined below.

[NOTE]
====
* Object stores are handled in the way described in this document only for applications deployed to CloudHub workers. For applications that you deploy via the Runtime Manager to local servers, you must handle the storage of data in your own repository. See xref:deployment-strategies.adoc[Deployment Options] for more details.
* All data in Object Store v1 is handled by servers in the *US-East zone*, regardless of what zone your application is deployed to. This may impact performance.
* xref:object-store::osv2-faq.adoc[Object Store v2] expands the number of cloud object store regions and object store capabilities for use with Mule 3.8.5 and later and for Mule 4.

== Store and Retrieve Data

To work with application data inside a Mule flow, use the Object Store connector. The connector provides operations to store, retrieve, list, and remove data from a Runtime Manager Object Store. The Object Store connector works with both Object Store v1 and Object Store v2.

[NOTE]
You must specify a unique partition name in the connector. To view information in *Runtime Manager* > *Application Data*, your connector project must contain an Object Store reference to the `_defaultUserObjectStore` Spring bean instance.

See:

* https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/org.mule.modules/mule-module-objectstore/[Object Store connector in Anypoint Exchange].
* xref:3.8@mule-runtime::object-store-connector.adoc#springbeans[Object Store Spring Bean Instances].

=== Store OAuth Data

For information on how to use the Object Store module to store and retrieve OAuth tokens, see the "Saving and Restoring State" section in the http://mulesoft.github.com/linkedin-connector/mule/linkedin-config.html#config[LinkedIn connector configuration] documentation for an example.

== View Application Data

To view application data, click your application name in Runtime Manager, click *Manage Application*, and click the *Application Data* tab. This tab contains a list of keys and values. You can view the data as plain text, or as a list.

[TIP]
To make properties secure so that they're not visible using the Runtime Manager UI or anywhere else, see xref:secure-application-properties.adoc[Secure Application Policies].

== Semantics and Storage Limits

Object Store v1 provides read-after-write consistency and the last write wins for updates.

Object Store v1 has a:

* Maximum of 100,000 keys per application
* 768 byte key size
* 1 MB value size
* 1 GB of data per application

Object Store v2:

* Works with Mule 3.8.5 and later, and Mule 4
* Unlimited number of keys per application
* Values can be up to 10 MB
* Trial level 10 TPS, premium level 100 TPS
* Keys persist for up to 30 days
* Available in xref:object-store::osv2-faq.adoc[all commercially available CloudHub regions].

== Advanced Information

Internally, Mule has several different types of object stores. Runtime Manager provides Object Store v1 (for Mule 3) and Object Store v2 (for Mule 3.8.5 and later, and Mule 4). These object stores are for runtime information about your application, such as those use cases mentioned above. You can find this object store internally in the Mule Registry under the '_defaultUserObjectStore` if you want to access it directly. The Object Store module and connectors use this store to store all their data by default.
