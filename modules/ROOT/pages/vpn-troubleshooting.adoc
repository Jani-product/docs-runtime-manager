These are some of the possible errors you may encounter when attempting to connect Anypoint VPN.

=== Unable to Connect to the Anypoint VPN

If you are unable to connect to the Anypoint VPN, ensure any firewalls that are configured are allowing traffic through the IP addresses in the `localExternalIpAddress` field in the VPN tunnels.

=== `NO_PROPOSAL_CHOSEN` Error or `Cannot Establish Phase 1 Connection`

This is likely due to a problem with your Phase 1 configuration.
Anypoint VPN connections support only IKEv1, meaning IKEv2 do not work.

Additionally, the following Phase 1 Diffie-Hellman (DH) groups are supported: 

* 2 
* 14-18 
* 22 - 24

=== Cannot Establish a Phase 2 Connection

It is possible that your Phase 2 DH group is not supported. The supported Phase 2 DH groups are: 

* 2
* 5
* 14-18
* 22-24

=== Anypoint VPN Tunnel Connection Works, but Routes are not Propagated

Ensure that the neighbor IP address for the tunnel is taken from the Local point-to-point IP address in the tunnelâ€™s details.

=== Phase 2 SA Established, but Traffic not Passing Through Tunnel

The VPN Connection supports only one Security Association (SA) pair per tunnel, so any more than one traffic selector per connection will cause unexpected results.

To solve this, ensure that only one unique SA is used per VPN tunnel connection. If more than one policy is needed, you must consolidate and filter traffic in your network.


=== Anypoint VPN Tunnel Disconnects After Period of Inactivity

IPsec is established by sending "interesting traffic" (traffic that should be encrypted over the Anypoint VPN connection). If there is no interesting traffic, the tunnel disconnects. This is the expected behavior, and the timeout value is variable.

Some VPN configurations require additional steps to keep the tunnel active. That is, you will need to ensure you are periodically sending interesting traffic. For example, sending ICMP requests every 5 seconds to a CloudHub worker's internal IP address or FQDN will keep the tunnel up.
