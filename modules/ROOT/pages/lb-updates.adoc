The CloudHub dedicated load-balancer service provides quarterly updates that include the latest OS and security patches. If necessary, additional patches provide updates more often.
These updates don't include feature changes. 

Because these updates contain required security patches, you cannot roll back these updates once applied.

When updates are available, an *Update* button appears on the load balancers page:

The *Update* button also appears on the details page for the individual load balancer:

== Update the Dedicated Load Balancer 

The *Update* button indicates a load balancer requires an update. You can schedule the update to occur at your convenience. Before updating the Production DLBs, update the Sandbox DLB and run required tests.

To update a load balancer:

. From Anypoint Platform, click *Runtime Manager*.
. Click *Load Balancers*.
. Click the *Update* button.
. At the *Update load balancer* prompt, click *Update*.
+
Click the *View release notes* link for details on the update.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When updating a DLB with static IP addresses, the update might add more static IPs. 
The update prompts you to add these these new IP addresses to your allowlist before continuing with the update.

In this case, add the IP addresses to your allowlist before clicking *Update*.
====

The update results in a rolling restart with no downtime. However, some inflight requests might be impacted. 

If you experience a sustained outage after updating, contact MuleSoft Support.
