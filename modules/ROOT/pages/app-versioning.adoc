= Application Versioning

Applications deployed to Runtime Fabric have a versioning feature for the application's configuration. Versioning enables you to:

* View the configuration change history of the application.
* Roll back configurations to an earlier version in case the currently applied configuration has issues or is unstable.
* Make updates to a deployed application's configuration, including:
** The application ZIP file
** Application version
** Deployment target settings, such as runtime version, number of replicas, and whether the application is running in cluster mode
** Resource allocations such as number of cores and memory allocation
** Ingress and property values

Each change to the application's configuration that is successfully deployed to Runtime Fabric is displayed in the *Config changes* column on the applications *Settings* page.
