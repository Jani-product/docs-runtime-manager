= Application Versioning

Applications deployed to Runtime Fabric have a versioning feature for the application's configuration. Versioning enables you to:

* View the configuration change history of the application.
* Roll back configurations to an earlier version in case the currently applied configuration has issues or is unstable.
* Make updates to a deployed application's configuration, including:
** The application ZIP file
** Application version
** Deployment target settings, such as runtime version, number of replicas, and whether the application is running in cluster mode
** Resource allocations such as number of cores and memory allocation
** Ingress and property values


== Access the Application's Settings Page

. Sign into Anypoint Platform and navigate to Runtime Manager (*Management Center > Runtime Manager*). +
The Applications page is displayed.
. In the *Applications* page, select one of the applications running on Runtime Fabric to open a panel on the right side.
. On that panel, click the *Manage Application* button to open the applicationâ€™s *Settings* page. +
The Settings page displays information about the application's status, configuration history, and other information about the application. +
Each change to the application's configuration that is successfully deployed to Runtime Fabric is displayed in the *Config changes* tab on the applications *Settings* page. The last 10 configuration deployments are displayed in order of their respective configuration date. Each configuration in the history has a unique hash to identify it.

[NOTE]
The configuration history displays the last 10 configuration deployments in order of creation date.

The *All changes* tab displays a history of versions created from the configuration deployment, and the actions (stopped, started) taken on each version.


== Apply Configuration Changes

. On the Settings page for the application, you can make the following changes to a deployed configuration: +
* Upload a new ZIP file.
* Make changes to the deployment target and resource allocation.
* Modify values for *Ingress* and *Properties*.
. Once your changes are made, click *Apply Changes*. +
At the top of the Settings page, a status bar appears.
+

. Click *View Status* to view the status for each replica in the deployment. +
The last successfully deployed configuration is retained until the new (desired) configuration is successfully deployed. +
New configurations are applied as "rolling updates." For example, a replica is created with the desired configuration, and once that configuration is successfully applied, the replica with the old configuration is deleted, and this process is repeated with each replica in the deployment. This model means there is zero downtime while updates are applied to the application.

+
Once the configuration is successfully applied and deployed, a message appears at the top of the page.
+

+
The application status, configuration identifier, date, and other information is updated in the status box.  The new configuration is displayed at the top of the *Config changes* list, along with a *Last successful* label to indicate that it's the last configuration successfully deployed.
