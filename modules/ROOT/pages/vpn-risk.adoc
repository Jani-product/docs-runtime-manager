Every VPN provisioned in Mulesoft has a risk associated depending on the state of the tunnels of the VPN.

For VPNs that are in High risk, MuleSoft recommends that customers plan to deploy a xref:vpn-high-availability.adoc[high-availability VPN] solution to avoid any downtime associated with AWS delivered auto-updates. Please refer the xref:vpn-maintenance.adoc[VPN Maintenance] for more details.


== Risk types

As mentioned before, the risk of a VPN depends on the number of UP tunnels.

There are 3 types of risk:

* UNAVAILABLE
* LOW
* HIGH


If both tunnels of the VPN are down, the risk of the VPN will be *UNAVAILABLE*, since no data is going through the VPN.

If the VPN has one tunnel UP and the other one DOWN, then the VPN will have *HIGH* risk.

If the VPN has both tunnels UP, then the VPN will have *LOW* risk.

== Check VPN risk in Anypoint Platform

The risk associated with your VPNs is shown in Anypoint Platform.

To check your VPN risk:

. Open Anypoint Platform
. Go to Runtime Manager
. Open the *VPNs* tab.
. Check the *Risk* of all VPNs
