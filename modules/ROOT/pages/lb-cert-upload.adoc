When you create a dedicated load balancer (DLB), you must add at least one certificate.
You can add additional certificates to a DLB using Runtime Manager or the command-line interface.

The certificate must be contained in one unencrypted, PEM-encoded file.
Convert all end of line characters to Linux convention (no '\r' characters).
If migrating a certificate from Windows tools, then remove all "Bag Attributes" and "Key Attributes".

This file must contain the entire certificate chain ordered sequentially: 

[%header,cols="30a,70a"]
|===
| Certificate | Example
| The Primary Certificate | -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- +
(Your Primary SSL certificate: your_domain_name.crt) +
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
| The Intermediate Certificate | -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- +
(Your Intermediate certificate: DigiCertCA.crt) +
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
|===

You don't need to include the root certificate in the certificate chain.
However, ensure that you include the ASCII armor in each certificate.


== Add a Certificate to an Existing Load Balancer

You can add a certificate to an existing DLB using Runtime Manager or the command-line interface.

To add a certificate using Runtime Manager:

. From Anypoint Platform, click *Runtime Manager*.
. Click *Load Balancers*, and then click the load balancer name.
. In the *Certificates* tab, click *Add certificate*.

** Public key file: `example-com-crt.pem`
** Private key file: `example-com-private.pem`

. Click *Save Certificate*.

To add a certificate to an existing DLB using the CLI: 

----
cloudhub load-balancer ssl-endpoint add myLB_name example-com-crt.pem example-com-private.pem
----


== Replace a Certificate on an Existing Load Balancer

You can replace a certificate on an existing DLB when the certificate is expiring or needs to be updated.

To replace a certificate using Runtime Manager:

. From Anypoint Platform, click *Runtime Manager*.
. Click *Load Balancers*, and then click the load balancer name.
. In the *Certificates* tab, click the certificate name.
. Select *Choose File* to upload the public key and private key files, such as:

** Public key file: `new-example-com-crt.pem`
** Private key file: `new-example-com-private.pem`

. Click *Done Editing*.
. Click *Apply Changes*.
