Registration is used for licensing, metering and billing. You must register every flex gateway regardless of how you want to manage it.

You can register your gateways in any of the following ways:

* Passing a token.
* Passing an Anypoint username and password.
* Passing a client ID and client secret.

If *Connected Mode* is specified, registered gateways show up in the Runtime Manager UI and become available as targets for deploying APIs in API Manager.
Each registered gateway is associated with one environment and one business group.

For detailed instructions on how to register your gateways, see xref:beta-flex-gateway-ga::flex-conn-reg-run.adoc[Registering and Running Flex Gateway in Connected Mode].

Registered gateways appear as *Connected* in the Runtime Manager UI.
