The Runtime Manager REST API enables you to programmatically access much of the functionality provided by the Runtime Manager. To deploy Mule applications using the Runtime Manager REST API, see https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/portals/anypoint-platform/f1e97bc6-315a-4490-82a7-23abe036327a.anypoint-platform/arm-rest-services[REST APIs].

For a more complete reference of all the operations that are supported through the API, see https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/apiplatform/anypoint-platform/#/portals/organizations/ae639f94-da46-42bc-9d51-180ec25cf994/apis/38784/versions/5567732/pages/182845[API Reference 1.26].
