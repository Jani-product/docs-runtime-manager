[TIP]
For instructions on how to perform these same tasks more easily using the Runtime Manager UI, see xref:cloudhub.adoc[CloudHub] and its child pages.

The `POST` operation specified with the `/api/applications` resource creates a new application on CloudHub.

Example Request:

[source,json,linenums]
----
POST https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/cloudhub/api/applications
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "domain" : "yourdomain",
  "workers" : 1,
  "muleVersion":"3.7.0",
  "properties" : {
     "your.system.property" : "some.value",
     "your.system.property.2" : "some.value.2"
  }
}
----

Example Response:

[source,json,linenums]
