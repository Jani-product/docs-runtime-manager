Event tracking enables you to to view real-time information about messages being processed by a specific flow. You can view message payloads before, during, and after they are processed, as well as information about the message processors in the flow and message metadata.

Event tracking provides visibility into business transactions and events on your Mule servers, enabling you to track and analyze the flow and disposition of particular messages. For example, you can use the data to perform root cause analysis on a failure within a business transaction, or to identify message processing bottlenecks.

== Notification Types

Mule runtime engine provides notifications about execution of a flow's components.

image::event-tracking.png[event_tracking]

Mule provides these notification types:

* Pipeline Message Notification
* Endpoint Message Notification
* Component Message Notification
* Event Notification (Custom Events)
* Message Processor Notification
* Async Message Notification
* Transaction Notification
* Exception Notification
* Exception Strategy Notification

== Pushed Event Information

For each notification, the Runtime Manager agent pushes the following information to the Event Tracking Service:

* `timestamp` — Timestamp for the event
* `notificationType` — Event type, such as Message Processor Event, and Inbound Endpoint Event
* `action` — Event action, such as Begin, End, Complete, and Rollback
* `resourceIdentifier` — Name of the flow
* `muleMessage` — If configured, pushes the serialized Mule message or an error message.

The Runtime Manager agent doesn't send this information:

* Mule Message ID
* Exception — Message and stack trace in case of an exception
* Path — Component Mule path
* Annotations — Annotations for the component, if any
* Application

== Event Tracking Notifications

The Runtime Manager agent stores event tracking notifications for Mule apps, then streams them to an Event Tracking Service. Depending on your network topology, and the design of your Mule apps, copying event tracking notifications over the network from the Runtime Manager agent to the online Event Tracking Service can significantly impact performance.

You can reduce performance impact by specifying tracking levels at different granularities. You can specify a global default event tracking level, then override it in named Mule apps. You can further override the event tracking level in specific named flows within a Mule app.

In addition to the event tracking level, you can use a message replay facility to store every message for later replay. Although it can potentially lead to duplicate message processing, the replay facility provides a mechanism for Ops to recover and replay failed transactions. As with tracking levels, you can configure the replay level globally, then override the level for specific Mule apps, or flows within a Mule app.

== Event Tracking Levels

The available event tracking levels are:

* `None` — Specifies no debugging.
* `BE` — Tracks only events related to business events.
* `Tracking` — Tracks `BE` level plus endpoint, exception strategy, and transaction-related notifications.
* `Debug` — Specifies `Tracking` level plus additional component and message processor notifications.
+
[IMPORTANT]
Because setting event tracking to `Debug` can result in slow performance, use this tracking level for debugging only.

This table lists the types of notifications active in each debugging level.

The MULE TYPE is the `org.mule.api.context.notification.ServerNotification` subclass (in the `org.mule.context.notification` package) that defines the notification type.

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|NOTIFICATIONS | MULE TYPE | NONE |BE |TRACKING |DEBUG
|Pipeline Message | PipelineMessageNotifications |  |√ |√ |√
|Async Message | AsyncMessageNotifications |  |√ |√ |√
|Exception | ExceptionStrategyNotifications |  |√ |√ |√

|Endpoint Message | EndpointMessageNotifications |  |  |√ |√
|Message Processor | MessageProcessorNotification |  |  |  |√
|Component Message | ComponentMessageNotifications |  |  |  |√
|===

== Configure Event Tracking

You can configure the tracking level globally, for an app, or for a flow.

To configure the global default tracking level, either:

* Edit the configuration file `mule-agent.yml`.
* Use the agent API to configure in real time.
+
See <<Configure Tracking Using the Agent API During Runtime>>.


=== Configure Event Tracking in mule-agent.yml

You can configure event tracking in `mule-agent.yml`:

* <<Configure Event Tracking Globally for All Mule Applications,Globally for all apps deployed to Mule>>
* <<Configure Tracking for a Mule App,For a single Mule app>>
* <<Configure Tracking for Flows in a Mule App,For flows in a Mule app>>


==== Configure Event Tracking Globally for All Mule Applications

The global default configuration specifies how to track all apps, and their flows, deployed to Mule runtime engine. Set the tracking configuration levels in the `services/mule.agent.tracking.service` section of the `mule-agent.yml` file.

This example sets the tracking level to `TRACKING`. See <<Event Tracking Levels>> for detailed descriptions of the tracking levels.

In `mule-agent.yml`:
[source,yaml,linenums]
----
services:
 mule.agent.tracking.service:
 globalTrackingLevel: TRACKING
----

If you don't specify `globalTrackingLevel`, the default value is `NONE`.

==== Configure Tracking for a Mule App

You can override the default global tracking level by setting tracking levels per Mule app.

The three Mule app level tracking areas are: `trackingLevel`, `replayLevel`, and `trackedFlows`.

* `trackingLevel`
+
Specifies one of the four tracking levels: `NONE`, `BE`, `TRACKING`, or `DEBUG`. This tracking level affects every flow in the Mule app. See <<Event Tracking Levels>>.
* `replayLevel`'
+
Specifies how to store each message through every flow of the Mule app for possible later replay: `NONE`, `SOURCED`, or `ALL`.

[[Replay]]
[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Replay Level Option | Description
|`NONE` |  Specifies to not store any data related to message replay and to disable the replay feature for these flows.
|`SOURCED` | Stores messages for later replay for only those flows in the Mule app that start with a message source.
|`ALL` |  Stores messages for later replay for every flow in the Mule app.
|===

This example sets the tracking level for the app `mule-flights` and its flow to `TRACKING`, and disables the message replay facility for this Mule app. The `mule-flights` app sends some notifications to the Event Tracking Service, but doesn't copy each received message. None of the flows in the `mule-flights` app can be replayed from the Event Tracking Service.

This example also sets `globalTrackingLevel` to override the default value `NONE`, so other Mule apps are also tracked at the `BE` level.

In `mule-agent.yml`:
[source,yaml,linenums]
----
services:
 mule.agent.tracking.service:
 globalTrackingLevel: BE
 trackedApplications:
    - appName: mule-flights
      trackingLevel: TRACKING
      replayLevel: NONE
----

==== Configure Tracking for Flows in a Mule App

You can override global and app-level settings for flows in the specified Mule app by adding the `trackedFlows` element. This element specifies what to track for a flow, and how message replay behaves.

This table describes the tracked flows options:

[%header%autowidth.spread]
|===
|Tracked Flow Option | Description
|`flow name` |  The name of the flow, as it is coded in the Mule app XML configuration file.
|`tracking level` |  One of the values `NONE`, `BE`, `TRACKING`, or `DEBUG`. See <<Event Tracking Levels>>.
|`replayLevel` |  One of the values `NONE`, `SOURCED`, or `ALL`. See the <<Replay,Replay Levels>> table.
|`payloadExcluded` |  If `replayLevel` is `SOURCED` or `ALL`, this determines whether to also store the message payload for later replay, or to just store the message metadata.
|===

This example adds flow-level tracking configuration to the `mule-flights` Mule app configuration. The global and Mule app-level tracking use the default values (`NONE`).

In `mule-agent.yml`:
[source,yaml,linenums]
----
services:
  mule.agent.tracking.service:
    trackedApplications:
      - appName: mule-flights
        trackedFlows:
          - flowName: purchaseFlight
            trackingLevel: DEBUG
            replayLevel: ALL
----


=== Complex Tracking Example

This example sets tracking levels and settings at all three levels: global, Mule app, and flow.

Global:

* `globalTrackingLevel` set to `OFF`, which is the default setting if you don't specify `globalTrackingLevel`.

App `mule-flights`:

* trackingLevel: `TRACKING` level for the apps.
* replayLevel: `OFF` for the app. Messages are not stored and replay is disabled.
** Flow `purchaseFlight`:
*** trackingLevel: `DEBUG` level for this one flow (overrides the `TRACKING` level).
*** replayLevel: `ALL` for this one flow. Saves every message for replay, even if the flow does not have a message source.

App `mule-ticketing`:

* trackingLevel: `BE` for the app.
* replayLevel: `SOURCE` for the app. Messages are not stored and replay is disabled.
** Flow `confirmReservation`:
*** trackingLevel: `DEBUG` level for this one flow (overrides the `TRACKING` level).
*** replayLevel: `ALL` for this one flow. Saves every message for replay, even if the flow does not have a message source.

All other apps in the Mule instance, and their flows:

* trackingLevel: `OFF` (the default)

In `mule-agent.yml`:
[source,yaml,linenums]
----
services:
  mule.agent.tracking.service:
    globalTrackingLevel: OFF
    trackedApplications:
      - appName: mule-flights
        trackingLevel: TRACKING
        replayLevel: OFF
        trackedFlows:
          - flowName: purchaseFlight
            trackingLevel: DEBUG
            replayLevel: ALL
          - flowName: help
            trackingLevel: OFF
            replayLevel: NONE
      - appName: mule-ticketing
        trackingLevel: BE
        replayLevel: SOURCE
        trackedFlows:
          - flowName: confirmReservation
            trackingLevel: DEBUG
            replayLevel: ALL
----

=== Configure Tracking Using the Agent API During Runtime

The agent API enables you to change the agent tracking configuration during runtime.


==== Retrieve the Current Configuration

This example retrieves information about the tracking service. The retrieved information includes the configurable fields with their current values.

Request:
----
GET <Runtime Manager Agent URL>/mule/agent/mule.agent.tracking.service
----

Response:
[source,json,linenums]
----
"configurableFields": [
    {
      "name": "globalTrackingLevel",
      "valueType": "com.mulesoft.agent.services.tracking.TrackingLevel",
