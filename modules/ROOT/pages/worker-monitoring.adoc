[NOTE]
Worker Monitoring is a feature that is only available for applications deployed to CloudHub workers. It is not available for applications that you deploy using the Runtime Manager to local servers. See xref:deployment-strategies.adoc[Deployment Strategies] and xref:monitoring.adoc[Monitoring Applications] for more details.

CloudHub supports worker monitoring and automatic restarts for unresponsive applications.
Monitoring allows you the option to receive notifications and diagnostic information if your application becomes unresponsive.
Optionally, enable automatic restarts so that your application can recover automatically without your intervention.
CloudHub gives you the flexibility to conduct monitoring with or without enabling automatic restarts.

Monitoring is enabled by default on all applications deployed on CloudHub. Applications already deployed before the monitoring feature was introduced need to be redeployed for monitoring to take effect. 

You can activate the automatic restart feature on a per-application basis using the Runtime Manager console when you deploy a new application or redeploy an existing application.

== Prerequisites

This document assumes that you are familiar with xref:deploying-to-cloudhub.adoc[Deploying to CloudHub] and that you are deploying to runtime 3.4.n, 3.5.n, or newer.

== Enable Automatic Restarts

You can enable automatic restarts when you initially deploy an app or after the app is deployed.

* During app deployment:
.. In Runtime Manager, click *Applications* in the menu on the left.
.. Click *Deploy Application* and select *CloudHub* from *Deployment Target*.
.. Select the *Automatically restart application when not responding* option:
+
.The arrow shows the *Automatically restart application when not responding* option.

.. Click *Deploy Application*.

* After the app is deployed:
.. In Runtime Manager, click *Applications* in the menu on the left.
.. Click the app status to display the details pane on the right
.. Click the *Manage Application* button to display the *Settings* page for the app.
.. Select the *Automatically restart application when not responding* option:
+
.The arrow shows the *Automatically restart application when not responding* option.

.. Click *Apply Changes*.

For applications running on Mule 3.8.x and earlier, upon deployment, CloudHub inserts a monitoring ping flow into your application.

When the application starts, the logs display a message to indicate that monitoring is enabled and that the ping flow has been injected into your application:

.The arrow shows the `Monitoring enabled` and `Registering ping flow injector` messages in the logs.

== How Monitoring Works

=== Mule 3.x.x 

Every 30 seconds, CloudHub sends an HTTP get request to the ping flow within the application. If the application is running normally, the ping flow sends a response. If CloudHub receives no response from the ping three times in a row, the logs print a warning and display a full thread dump.

=== Mule 4.x.x

Every 30 seconds, CloudHub checks the PID of the Mule process. If CloudHub detects the application process is not running three times in a row, the logs print a warning.

In both cases, CloudHub triggers a notification to the console to alert you that a worker for any application stopped responding.

If you have configured email alerts, the non-responsive worker also triggers an email alert based on the `Worker Not Responding` event. See  xref:alerts-on-runtime-manager.adoc[Alerts] for more information about configuring these alerts.

== How Automatic Restarts Work

If you check the box labeled **Automatically restart application when not responding**, CloudHub follows the same procedure described above, but also automatically triggers redeployment of the application.

If you do not have this box checked, CloudHub only produces a notification and a log message and takes no further action.

The monitoring script exits and the application is left unchanged until you manually intervene.

If you have enabled automatic restart, CloudHub produces a notification to signal that the restart has been triggered and another to report the success or failure of the restart:

image::ch-monitoring-notifications.png[CH-monitoring-notifications]

The logs report the details of the restart procedure. If the restart succeeds, the ping script is reinitialized so that monitoring continues.

If the restart fails, CloudHub continues to attempt restarting up to five times. Once the maximum number of restart attempts is exceeded, CloudHub takes no further action. The monitoring script exits and the application is left unchanged until you manually intervene.
