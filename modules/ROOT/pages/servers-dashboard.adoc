The servers dashboard provides information about server performance, including heap memory and CPU performance. This dashboard also provides the following information:

* A list of applications deployed to the server
* The status of each application
* Mule messages for each application
* Error messages for each application

The Dashboards feature isn't available on the Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition.

If you select any of the servers, server groups or clusters on the Servers tab, a panel opens on the right. Here you can read additional information and access some configuration items.

What this dashboard displays depends on whether it's a server, server group, or cluster and on what Mule versions are in use. You will always see the status, the Mule version installed in it (server groups and clusters must all have the same Mule version installed to work together), the Runtime Manager agent version in use, in case of clusters and server groups you will also see the type (unicast or multicast).


A series of tabs in the bottom allow you to see details about:

* The applications running and the status of each
* Clusters and server groups display the list of servers and the status of each
* Any plugins, such as xref:sending-data-from-arm-to-external-analytics-software.adoc[Export Data to External Analytics Tools]

On all panels, two buttons are displayed:

* The *View Dashboard* button, which takes you to the server's dashboard page. This page displays more detailed performance metrics and the evolution of these over time, see xref:monitoring-dashboards.adoc#server-monitoring-dashboard[Server Monitoring Dashboard].
