The Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) offering allows you to create a virtual, private, and isolated network segment in the cloud to host your CloudHub workers.

Connecting to your CloudHub VPC extends your corporate intranet and allows CloudHub workers to access resources behind your corporate firewall. You can connect on-premises data centers through a secured VPN tunnel, or a private AWS VPC through VPC peering, or by using AWS Direct Connect.

The base VPC subscription includes two VPCs and each VPC can be associated with multiple environments. This allows you, for example, to have one isolated network for your production environment, and another for your QA and staging. Your licensing requirements will depend on your specific deployment scenario. 

CloudHub VPC supports different Amazon regions. During setup, you need to specify which Amazon region you want. You can even have multiple VPCs inside a single Amazon region, however this is not a standard setup and you need to specify this requirement when provisioning your VPC.

Each VPC allows you to configure firewall rules to apply to your workers. You can choose to expose or block your custom ports and even block requests to your apps coming from CloudHub's shared load balancer. +
Additionally, you can configure one or more dedicated load balancers to validate requests using your own SSL certificates, and to map input URLs to call to different CloudHub applications. +
Combining firewall rules and dedicated load balancers configurations, you can fine tune how external services reach your applications.
