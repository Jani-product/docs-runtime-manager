Anypoint Flex Gateway can run in two modes:

== Local Mode

You can download Anypoint Flex Gateway for free and install it on a Linux server, VM, or Kubernetes cluster to immediately start applying out-of-the-box policies to non-Mule APIs running on those targets through declarative configuration files.

[NOTE]
Local Mode flex gateways will not show in Anypoint Runtime Manager.

== Connected Mode

With a paid license, you can configure Anypoint Flex Gateway to surface your gateways in Runtime Manager, and their APIs and policy configurations in API Manager.

With Connected Mode Flex Gateway, you can manage all your non-Mule APIs from a single unified control plane.
You also get monitoring and reusability capabilities through API Analytics and Exchange.
