= Monitoring Dashboards on Runtime Manager
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

endif::[]


The monitoring dashboards give you in-depth visibility into usage metrics about both your deployed apps and the systems they're deployed to. The dashboards give you a view into the evolution of metrics about your apps and servers. 

The dashboard helps you answer questions about your integrated apps, such as:

* When did peaks in usage occur?
* What impact do high traffic peaks have on response time?
* How well is the processing power behind my app coping with these high traffic peaks?
* What impact do high traffic peaks have on the message fail rate?
* What impact do high traffic peaks of other apps running on the same server have on the performance of a given app?

To help you analyze the root cause of failures, isolate performance bottlenecks, and test for compliance with company procedures, you can use xref:insight.adoc[Insight].

== Access the Monitoring Dashboard for Applications

To view dashboards, you must have the Runtime Manager permissions *Read Application* or *Read Servers* for the resource.

. In Runtime Manager, in the menu on the left, click *Applications*. 
. In the list of applications, click the name of the application to monitor. +
The monitoring dashboard opens for the selected application. 

== View Application Metrics

To view all graphs for different time ranges, select the time interval from the top of the page.

If your application runs on multiple workers, they are charted as different curves on the same graphs, differentiated by different colors.

If your application runs on a cluster or server group, the aggregated metrics of the entire set of servers included in the server group or cluster are charted as a single plot line.

[TIP]
If you run your app on a cluster or server group and want to see the metrics at the individual server level, you can look at the dashboard for the individual server. If multiple apps are running on the server, you see the overall server performance, without a distinction between each of the apps running on it.

== Alerts

Set up xref:alerts-on-runtime-manager.adoc#conditions-on-locally-deployed-applications[alerts] for applications and servers to notify you automatically whenever any of these metrics reaches a critical value for a sustained period of time.

== Access the Monitoring Dashboard for Servers

[NOTE]
The Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition doesn't support the monitoring dashboard feature.

. In Runtime Manager, in the menu on the left, click *Servers*. 
. Click the row for the server to open the management panel on the right side of the page.
. Click the *View Dashboard* button. +
The dashboard for the server is displayed.

You can also navigate to a server's dashboard if you first open the dashboard for a cluster or server group that contains the server, then click the name of the server.

== View Server Metrics

The monitoring dashboard for servers displays several metrics, which are divided into two panes:

* *Overview*: View memory and CPU usage for the server at a high level.
* *Breakdown*: View detailed metrics that track each part of the server's memory separately.

To view graphs for a specific time period, select the time interval on the top-right of the page.

image::monitoring-dashboards-cbd92.png[]

Hover your mouse over a given point of a graph, to display an overlay of numerical detail about activity on that instant.

If your server runs multiple applications, you can select applications in the list to view the performance of these in a separate set of charts. To do so, select the application and a side-panel will display on the right with this data.

=== Server Metrics

The graphs in this server's dashboard cover different metrics related to memory and CPU usage. You can see these metrics at a high level on the *Overview* tab, or you can view the *Breakdown* to see a detailed series of metrics that tracks each part of the memory separately.

The graphs in this dashboard display memory usage levels in both the *Overview* and the *Breakdown* tabs, and track these values:

* *Used* - The amount of memory (in MB) that is currently in use. 
If the Java VM attempts to increase the used memory to be greater than committed memory, even if the amount of used memory is increased to below the total memory, memory allocation fails.
* *Committed* - The amount of memory (in MB) that's available for use by the Java VM. This amount varies over time. The amount of committed memory is always greater than or equal to the amount of used memory.
* *Total* - The maximum amount of memory (in MB) for use by the server. The maximum amount can change or be undefined. 

=== JVM Heap Memory

The heap is the area where all Java objects reside. The heap is created when the JVM starts, and can scale up or down in size without interrupting the applications in it. When the heap becomes full, <<garbage_collection,garbage is collected>> to clear objects that are no longer used and make space for new objects.

The non-heap memory stores per-class structures such as a runtime constant pool, field and method data, and the code for methods and constructors.

This metric in the *Overview* is the total heap memory usage in MB. See the <<Breakdown Tab,*Breakdown* tab>> for details about each of its components.

* Heap memory usage
* Heap committed memory
* Total memory

=== CPU

This metric in the *Overview* tab is the total CPU usage of the server, as a percentage.

image::monitoring-dashboards-cpu.png[]

* CPU usage
* System available processing power
* System load average

+
[NOTE]
This metric is not available in Windows.

=== Thread Count

This graph displays the number of individual threads over time.

image::monitoring-dashboards-threads.png[]

Threads here refer to threads of execution in Java. The JVM allows an application to have multiple threads of execution running concurrently.

[[garbage_collection]]
=== Garbage Collection

The JVM implements the garbage collection mark-and-sweep algorithm, which consists of two phases:

* Phase One: This is the mark phase, where the garbage collection algorithm finds and marks all accessible objects. 
* Phase Two: This is the sweep phase, where the garbage collection algorithm scans through the heap and reclaims all the unmarked objects.

=== Class Loading

The class loading graph shows the amount of classes that are currently loaded, or being loaded, in total across all apps in the JVM.

image::monitoring-dashboards-classloading.png[]

=== Heap Memory Metrics

The following metrics relate to the portion of the server memory that makes up the JVM Heap.

==== Par Eden / Eden Space

The pool in the Heap Space from which memory is initially allocated for most objects.

image::monitoring-dashboards-eden.png[]

==== Par Survivor / Survivor Space

The pool in the Heap containing objects that have survived the garbage collection of the Eden space.

image::monitoring-dashboards-survivor.png[]

==== Tenured Generation

The pool in the Heap containing objects that have existed for some time in the survivor space.

image::monitoring-dashboards-tenure.png[]

=== Non-heap Memory Metrics

The following metrics refer to memory that exists outside the JVM Heap.

==== Code Cache

This non-heap space contains memory that is used for compilation and storage of native code.

image::monitoring-dashboards-cahce.png[]

==== Compressed Class Space

[NOTE]
This metric is only available when using JDK 8+.

image::monitoring-dashboards-class-space.png[]

==== Metaspace

JVM memory space that uses native memory for the representation of class metadata.
This metric is only available when using JDK 8+.

image::monitoring-dashboards-meta.png[]

== Server Group and Cluster Dashboards

=== Access the Server Group or Cluster Dashboard

To access the dashboard of a cluster or a server group on-premises:

. Select a cluster or server group in the *Servers* page to open the side panel.
. Click the *View Dashboard* button. +
The dashboard for the server group or cluster displays. 

=== Navigating the Dashboard

The dashboard displays three separate metrics:

* CPU usage, as a percentage of the capacity
* Memory usage, in MB
* Heap total, in MB

image::monitoring-dashboards-5cd3c.png[]

You can view graphs for specific time periods by selecting the desired time interval in the top-right corner.

image::monitoring-dashboards-cbd92.png[]

The aggregated metrics of the entire set of servers included will be charted as a single plot line on the main set of graphs.

You can break down this information into either individual servers or individual applications, note the two tabs that allow you to pick a perspective:

image::monitoring-dashboards-6fe9f.png[]

Then, select one or many servers or applications, and a side-panel will display on the right with this data.

From this menu, you can also click on an individual server name to be taken to the dashboard page for <<The Dashboard for a Server, that individual server>>.

[TIP]
Set up xref:alerts-on-runtime-manager.adoc#conditions-on-mule-servers[Alerts] to notify you automatically whenever any of these metrics hits a critical value for a sustained period of time.
