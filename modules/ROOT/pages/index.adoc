Use Runtime Manager to deploy and manage all of your Mule applications from one central location, whether your apps are running in the cloud, on-premises, or on Runtime Fabric.

Runtime Manager is designed specifically for handling Mule applications, and deploying them to the available Mule runtime instances in a xref:cloudhub.adoc[CloudHub] virtual worker, or an on-premises Mule server (server group, cluster, and so on), or Runtime Fabric. 

[NOTE]
xref:cloudhub.adoc[CloudHub] is a complete integration platform as a service (iPaaS) that covers all of your server needs out of the box, including Object Store infrastructure, Monitoring, Troubleshooting, Scheduling, and so on. Use Runtime Manager to deploy to CloudHub.

== Architecture

The cloud-based version of the Anypoint Platform has a Runtime Manager with a console that allows you to manage applications deployed to xref:cloudhub.adoc[CloudHub] or elsewhere. 

If you are using the on-premises Runtime Manager you can deploy anywhere _except_ CloudHub.

For applications deployed to CloudHub (Cloud runtime in the diagram below) you can use xref:insight.adoc[Insight] for analytics and monitoring. For applications that you deploy on-premises or to your private cloud servers you can xref:sending-data-from-arm-to-external-analytics-software.adoc[send data to third-party Analytics applications].

Runtime Manager provides a dashboard that indicates the status of every deployed app and monitored server, with a rich set of features you can use to manage and track activity of your running applications.
