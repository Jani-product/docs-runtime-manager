Anypoint Runtime Manager is the interface to https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoint Platform]
that provides a unified view of your applications, servers, and APIs.

With Runtime Manager, you can deploy, manage, and monitor your Mule applications in a sandbox, staging,
or production environment from one central location, whether your apps are deployed in the cloud or on-premises.

You can use Runtime Manager in these scenarios: 

CloudHub::
MuleSoft hosts your app deployments in CloudHub and you use the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoint Platform] Runtime Manager cloud console to manage them.
+
CloudHub is a complete integration platform as a service (iPaaS) that automatically meets all of your server needs without requiring any configuration or customization, including object store infrastructure, monitoring, troubleshooting, and scheduling.

Hybrid::
You host your app deployments on your on-premises Mule servers and use the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoint Platform] Runtime Manager cloud console to manage them.

Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition::
You host your app deployments on your local Mule servers and use the on-premises Runtime Manager instance 
included with Anypoint Platform PCE to manage them.
+
If you are using the on-premises Runtime Manager, you can deploy anywhere _except_ CloudHub.

Anypoint Runtime Fabric::
You host your app deployments on your locally installed Runtime Fabric instance and use the https://anypoint.mulesoft.com[Anypoint Platform] Runtime Manager cloud console to manage them.

For applications deployed to CloudHub, you can use Insight for analytics and monitoring.

For applications that you deploy on-premises or to your private cloud servers, you can send data to third-party analytics applications.


[NOTE]
When you run an app in Anypoint Studio, the app deploys to an embedded test server in Studio.
Because this server is not meant for production deployment and uptime restrictions apply,
deploy your Mule app using one of the deployment options supported by Runtime Manager.
