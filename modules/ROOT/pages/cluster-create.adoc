= Create a Cluster using Runtime Manager (Hybrid)
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

== Prerequisites

Before creating a cluster, ensure you have performed the following:

* Install Mule version 3.6 or later, or API gateway runtime version 2.0 or later.
* Install Runtime Manager Agent version 1.1.1 or later.
* Create a server for each Mule you want to include in your cluster.

Also, note the following considerations when creating a cluster:

* None of the servers you select for creating a new cluster can contain any *previously deployed applications*.

* Multicast servers can be in the status states of *Running* or *Disconnected*, whereas unicast servers can be only in the *Running* state. 

* All servers in a cluster must be running the same Mule runtime engine version and Runtime Manager agent version.

If you wish to have Object Store persistence on all servers of your cluster, you must create your cluster manually and use Quorum Management.

== Creating a Cluster

. From Anypoint Platform, click *Runtime Manager*.
. Click the *Servers* tab.
. Ensure that all servers are visible in the Servers list.
. Click *Create Cluster*. Servers can be added to a cluster in any status.
