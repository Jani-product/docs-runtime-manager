== Prerequisites

Before you can create a cluster, you must perform these steps:

* Install Mule version 3.7.0 or later, or API gateway runtime version 2.0 or later.
* Install Runtime Manager Agent version 1.1.1 or later.
* For each Mule, add the server that connects Mule to Runtime Manager.


== Restrictions

To add servers to a cluster:

* Servers cannot contain any previously deployed applications.
* Servers cannot belong to another cluster or group.
* Multicast servers can be in *Running* or *Disconnected* state. 
* Unicast servers must be in the *Running* state. 
* All servers in a cluster must be running the same Mule runtime engine version and Runtime Manager agent version.

For Object Store persistence on all the servers in your cluster, create your cluster manually and use Quorum Management.

== Create a Cluster

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager*.
. Click *Servers*.

. In the *Create Cluster* page, enter the name for the cluster.
+
Cluster names can contain between 3-40 alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and hyphens (-). They cannot start or end with a hyphen and cannot contain spaces or other characters.
. Select *Unicast* or *Multicast*.
. Select the servers to include in your new cluster. 
. Click *Create Cluster*.

The new cluster appears in the *Servers* list. The servers no longer appear in the *Servers* list. To see the list of servers in the cluster, click the cluster name.
