To deploy applications to a cluster, you can either add the servers to Runtime Manager first, then create the cluster or you can create the cluster and add servers to it later.

For Object Store persistence on all the servers in your cluster, create your cluster manually and use Quorum Management.


== Restrictions

To add servers to a cluster:

* Servers cannot contain any previously deployed applications.
* Servers cannot belong to another cluster or group.
* Multicast servers can be in the *Running* or *Disconnected* state. 
* Unicast servers must be in the *Running* state. 
* All servers in a cluster must be running the same Mule runtime engine version and Runtime Manager agent version.


== Create a Cluster

To create a cluster:

. From Anypoint Platform, select *Runtime Manager*.
. Select *Servers* in the left menu.
. Click the *Create Cluster* button:
+
.The arrow shows the *Create Cluster* button on the *Servers* page.

. In the *Create Cluster* page, enter the name for the cluster.

Cluster names can contain between 3-40 alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and hyphens (-). They cannot start or end with a hyphen and cannot contain spaces or other characters.
. Select *Unicast* or *Multicast*.
. Select the servers to include in your new cluster. 
. Click the *Create Cluster* button.

The new cluster appears in the *Servers* list. The servers no longer appear in the *Servers* list. To see the list of servers in the cluster, click the cluster name.
