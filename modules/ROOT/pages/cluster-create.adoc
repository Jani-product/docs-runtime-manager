= Create a Cluster using Runtime Manager (Hybrid)
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

== Prerequisites

Before you can create a cluster, you must:

* Install Mule version 3.6 or later, or API gateway runtime version 2.0 or later.
* Install Runtime Manager Agent version 1.1.1 or later.
* Create a server for each Mule you want to include in your cluster.

[NOTE]
--
* None of the servers you select for a new cluster can contain any previously deployed applications, nor can they belong to another cluster or group.
* Multicast servers can have status states of *Running* or *Disconnected*, whereas unicast servers must be in the *Running* state. 
* All servers in a cluster must be running the same Mule runtime engine version and Runtime Manager agent version.
* To have Object Store persistence on all the servers in your cluster, you must create your cluster manually and use Quorum Management.
