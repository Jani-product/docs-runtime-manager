Using Runtime Manager, you can register and set up the properties of servers, server groups, and clusters that reside on-premises. After setting up a server, you can select it as the deployment target for your applications.

== Server Groups and Clusters

Both server groups and clusters run applications in multiple distributed nodes.  When using a server group, instances of the applications are completely isolated from each other. In a cluster configuration, the nodes are aware of one another and share common information and synchronize statuses.

== Alerts

You can set up email alerts that are sent whenever certain events occur to your servers, such as a server being disconnected, or a server being removed from a cluster. These alerts may be linked to a specific server or to all of them. See xref:alerts-on-runtime-manager.adoc[Alerts] for instructions on how to do this.
