After creating a server, you can control its status from Runtime Manager. 

After shutting down a server, you cannot start it from Runtime Manager. You must manually start the server on the system where Mule runtime engine is installed.

Depending on the error, if an error occurs in Runtime Manager during server shutdown or restart, you might need to manually start or stop the server on the system where Mule is installed.
