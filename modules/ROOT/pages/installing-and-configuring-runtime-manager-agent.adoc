Anypoint Runtime Manager agent is used to register Mule runtime engine (Mule) with Runtime Manager. After Mule is registered, you can manage it with Runtime Manager within the specific environment and Anypoint Platform business group in which it was registered. Mule can't be registered with multiple Runtime Manager business groups or environments.

The `amc_setup` command is used to install and configure the agent. You use different parameters with `amc_setup` depending on the type of console to which you are connecting the agent:

* <<Register Mule with the MuleSoft-Managed Runtime Manager,Anypoint Platform Runtime Manager cloud-based console>>
* <<Register Mule with Anypoint Platform PCE Runtime Manager,Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition Runtime Manager console>>


When you run `amc_setup`, the agent creates the `$MULE_HOME/conf/mule-agent.yml` with the configuration options you specified. After initial installation, you can:

* Rerun `amc_setup` to change the agent configuration or to update the agent version.
* Modify `mule-agent.yml` to change the agent configuration.
+
Some configuration options, such as extending JMX monitoring to other external services, are not possible using `amc_setup`. You must manually add them to `mule-agent.yml`. See xref:rtm-agent-config-yaml.adoc[Update Agent Configuration in mule-agent.yml].


=== Important Notes

* Do not register a single Mule runtime engine with more than one Runtime Manager business group or environment.
* Do not register Mule with Runtime Manager more than once.
* Do not register a Mule runtime engine with both an older xref:mule-management-console::index.adoc[Mule Management Console (MMC)] and Runtime Manager.
+
If Mule is currently managed in MMC, first unregister it with MMC before running `amc_setup`.
+
MuleSoft support provides migration scripts to migrate from MMC to Runtime Manager.


== Compatibility 

The version of Runtime Manager agent must support the version of Mule and Runtime Manager you are using. To determine compatibility, check the xref:release-notes::runtime-manager-agent/runtime-manager-agent-release-notes.adoc[Runtime Manager Agent Release Notes].

Mule 3.7.x and earlier and the API gateway 2.x and earlier include an earlier version of Runtime Manager agent, which doesn't provide support for exporting data to external analytics tools. If you are running these earlier versions, you can download and update the agent to the latest version.

== Prerequisites

* Your enterprise license is current. 
* You are running Mule 3.6.0 and later, and the API gateway 2.1 and later.

These instructions use paths for Mac or Linux. If you are using Windows, replace the `$MULE_HOME` path with `%MULE_HOME%`.


== Install the Agent From a Mule Installation

The agent is bundled with the Mule runtime engine installation.

To install the agent:

. xref:4.2@mule-runtime::runtime-installation-task.adoc[Download and install Mule].
. Run `$MULE_HOME/bin/amc_setup` and specify parameters for your installation.
+
See <<amc_setup Parameters>>.

== Install the Agent From a .zip file

If you need a different version of the agent than the version included in the software distribution, you can download it from the Support Portal. 

=== Download the Agent From the Support Portal

To verify compatibility with your Mule runtime engine and Runtime Manager, check the corresponding xref:release-notes::runtime-manager-agent/runtime-manager-agent-release-notes.adoc[Runtime Manager Agent Release Notes]. 

To download the agent:

. Open the https://help.mulesoft.com/s/[MuleSoft Help Center].
. Click the *Support* tile.
. Click *Login* in the upper right and log in using your Anypoint Platform credentials.
+
IMPORTANT: You must have an Enterprise support account to download the agent.
. In the MuleSoft Support page, click the *Downloads* tab.
. Click *Mule Agent*.
. Locate the agent to install and click *Download* in the Action column. 

=== Install the Agent

To install the agent from the downloaded .zip file:

. Stop Mule or the API gateway runtime.
. Extract the downloaded `agent-setup-_VERSION_.zip` file to `$MULE_HOME/bin`.
+
If prompted, overwrite any conflicting files.
. Run `$MULE_HOME/bin/amc_setup` and specify parameters for your installation.
+
See <<amc_setup Parameters>>.
. Restart Mule or the API gateway runtime.


== Update Runtime Manager Agent

If you previously installed the agent with an earlier version of `amc_setup`, you can update the agent and retain your existing agent configuration in `$MULE_HOME/conf/mule-agent.yml`.

To update an existing Runtime Manager agent:

. Stop Mule or the API gateway runtime.
. Extract the downloaded `agent-setup-_VERSION_.zip` file to `$MULE_HOME/bin`.
. When prompted, overwrite any conflicting files.
. Run `$MULE_HOME/bin/amc_setup -U`.
+
When you run `amc_setup` with the `-U` parameter, you can't include other parameters on the command line.
. Restart Mule or the API gateway runtime.


=== What Happens When You Update the Agent

When you update the agent, the `amc_setup` script:

* Backs up the current version of the agent:
** Archives the `$MULE_HOME/plugins/MULE_AGENT_PLUGIN_FOLDER` to `$MULE_HOME/tools/mule-agent-backup.zip`
** Archives any custom modules (usually located in `$MULE_HOME/plugins/MULE_AGENT_PLUGIN_FOLDER/lib/modules`) to `$MULE_HOME/tools/mule-agent-modules-backup.zip`
* Updates agent libs in `$MULE_HOME/plugins/MULE_AGENT_PLUGIN_FOLDER/lib`
* Retains the current `$MULE_HOME/conf/mule-agent.yml` configuration file
* Leaves modules in `$MULE_HOME/plugins/MULE_AGENT_PLUGIN_FOLDER/lib/modules` unchanged
+
This folder contains all custom modules added to the agent (not included in the agent distribution).

== Uninstall the Agent

To uninstall the agent:

. Stop Mule or the API gateway runtime.
. Remove these files:
+
`$MULE_HOME/conf/mule-agent.jks`
+
`$MULE_HOME/conf/mule-agent.yml`
. Restart Mule or the API gateway runtime.


== amc_setup Parameters

== Register Mule with the MuleSoft-Managed Runtime Manager

To register Mule with the MuleSoft-managed Anypoint Platform Runtime Manager console, you need:

* A valid registration token, which identifies a specific environment for a specific business group in Anypoint Platform.
* An instance name, which identifies Mule in the Runtime Manager console.


To register Mule:

. In Runtime Manager, click *Servers* in the left menu.
. Click the *Add Server* button.
+
Runtime Manager generates the `amc_setup` command, including `_token_` and `_server-name_`, to use to register Mule in your environment. 
+
The registration token includes your organization's ID and the current environment.
. Click *Copy* to copy the command.
. In a terminal window, change to the `$MULE_HOME/bin` directory for the Mule that you're registering.
. Paste the command on the command line.
. Change the instance name `server-name` to the unique name to use to label Mule in the Runtime Manager console.
+
The `server-name` is unique across environments. The `server-name` can be the same for the same organization in different environments.
+
. Include any other parameters on the `amc_setup` command line.
+ 
See <<amc_setup Parameters>>.
+
For example:
+
[source,console,linenums]
----
./amc_setup -H myToken myMuleServer --proxy myProxy-host myProxy-port myProxy-user myProxy-password
----

The `amc_setup` command generates the `$MULE_HOME/conf/mule-agent.yml` file. 

=== Example mule-agent.yml file

Here is an example `mule-agent.yml` file generated by the `-H` option:

[source,yaml,linenums]

== Register Mule with Anypoint Platform PCE Runtime Manager

With Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition, all Runtime Manager services run on-premises rather than in a MuleSoft-hosted cloud environment.

To register Mule with PCE Runtime Manager:

. Log into an Anypoint Platform PCE account.
. Ensure that you have correctly set up the DNS entry for your platform.
+
See xref:access-management::private-cloud-edition-features.adoc#dns-or-ip[DNS or IP].
. Select a business group and environment to register Mule.
. Within the selected environment, click *Servers* in the left menu.
. Click the *Add Server* button.
+
Runtime Manager generates the `amc_setup` command, including `_token_` and `_server-name_`, to use to register Mule in your environment. 
+
The registration token includes your organization's ID and the current environment.
. Click *Copy* to copy the command.
. In a terminal window, change to the `$MULE_HOME/bin` directory for the Mule that you're registering.
. Paste the command on the command line.
. Change the instance name `server-name` to the unique name to use to label Mule in the Runtime Manager console.
. Include any other parameters on the `amc_setup` command line.
+
See <<amc_setup Parameters>>.
. Append parameters to the command line to specify the URLs of services used by Runtime Manager to manage your Mule.
+
See <<PCE Runtime Manager amc_setup Parameters>>.
+
For example:
+
[source,console,linenums]
----
./amc_setup -H myToken myMuleServer -A +http://$DOCKER_IP_ADDRESS:8080/hybrid/api/v1+ -W "wss://_Anypoint Platform host_:8443/mule" -C https://_AnypointPlatform host_/accounts -F https://AnypointPlatformHost/apiplatform
----

The `amc_setup` command generates the `$MULE_HOME/conf/mule-agent.yml` file.
