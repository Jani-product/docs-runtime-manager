The Anypoint Runtime Manager agent registers Mule runtime engine (Mule) with Runtime Manager. After Mule is registered, you can manage it using Runtime Manager within the specific environment and Anypoint Platform business group in which Mule was registered. You cannot register Mule with multiple Runtime Manager business groups or environments.

Use the `amc_setup` command to install and configure the agent, using different parameters depending on the type of console to which you are connecting the agent:

* <<Register Mule with the Cloud-Based Runtime Manager,Anypoint Platform Runtime Manager cloud-based console>>
* <<Register Mule with Anypoint Platform PCE Runtime Manager,Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition Runtime Manager console>>


When you run `amc_setup`, the agent creates the `$MULE_HOME/conf/mule-agent.yml` with the configuration options you specified. After initial installation, you can:

* Rerun `amc_setup` to change the agent configuration or to update the agent version.
* Modify `mule-agent.yml` to change the agent configuration.
+
Some configuration options, such as extending JMX monitoring to other external services, are not possible using `amc_setup`. You must manually add them to `mule-agent.yml`. See xref:rtm-agent-config-yaml.adoc[Update Agent Configuration in mule-agent.yml].


== Requirements and Restrictions

* Do not register a single Mule runtime engine with more than one Runtime Manager business group or environment.
* Do not register Mule with Runtime Manager more than once.
* Do not register a Mule runtime engine with both an older xref:mule-management-console::index.adoc[Mule Management Console (MMC)] and Runtime Manager.
+
If Mule is currently managed in MMC, first unregister it with MMC before running `amc_setup`.
+
MuleSoft support provides migration scripts to migrate from MMC to Runtime Manager.


== Compatibility 

The version of Runtime Manager agent must support the version of Mule and Runtime Manager you are using. To determine compatibility, check the xref:release-notes::runtime-manager-agent/runtime-manager-agent-release-notes.adoc[Runtime Manager Agent Release Notes].

Mule 3.7.x and earlier and the API gateway 2.x and earlier include an earlier version of the Runtime Manager agent, which doesn't provide support for exporting data to external analytics tools. If you are running these earlier versions, you can download and update the agent to the latest version.

== Prerequisites

* Your enterprise license is current. 
* You are running Mule 3.6.0 and later, and the API gateway 2.1 and later.
* If you must download the agent, you must have an Enterprise support account.


These instructions use paths for Mac or Linux. If you are using Windows, replace the `$MULE_HOME` path with `%MULE_HOME%`.

== Install the Agent from a Mule Installation

The agent is bundled with the Mule runtime engine installation.

To install the agent:

. xref:4.2@mule-runtime::runtime-installation-task.adoc[Download and install Mule].
. Run `$MULE_HOME/bin/amc_setup` and specify parameters for your installation.
+
See <<amc_setup Parameters>>.

== Install the Agent From a .zip File

If you need a different version of the agent than the version included in the software distribution, you can download it from the Support Portal. 

=== Download the Agent from the Support Portal

To verify compatibility with your Mule runtime engine and Runtime Manager, check the corresponding xref:release-notes::runtime-manager-agent/runtime-manager-agent-release-notes.adoc[Runtime Manager Agent Release Notes]. 

To download the agent:

. Open https://help.mulesoft.com/s/[MuleSoft Help Center].
. Click the *Support* tile.
. Click *Login* in the upper right and log in using your Anypoint Platform credentials.
+
IMPORTANT: You must have an Enterprise support account to download the agent.
. In the MuleSoft Support page, click the *Downloads* tab.
. Click *Mule Agent*.
. Locate the agent to install and click *Download* in the Action column. 

=== Install the Agent

To install the agent from the downloaded .zip file:

. Stop Mule or the API gateway runtime.
. Extract the downloaded `agent-setup-_VERSION_.zip` file to `$MULE_HOME/bin`.
+
If prompted, overwrite any conflicting files.
. Run `$MULE_HOME/bin/amc_setup` and specify parameters for your installation.
+
See <<amc_setup Parameters>>.
. Restart Mule or the API gateway runtime.


== Update the Runtime Manager Agent

If you previously installed the agent with an earlier version of `amc_setup`, you can update the agent and retain your existing agent configuration in `$MULE_HOME/conf/mule-agent.yml`.

To update an existing Runtime Manager agent:

. Stop Mule or the API gateway runtime.
. Extract the downloaded `agent-setup-_VERSION_.zip` file to `$MULE_HOME/bin`.
. When prompted, overwrite any conflicting files.
. Run `$MULE_HOME/bin/amc_setup -U`.
+
When you run `amc_setup` with the `-U` parameter, you can't include other parameters on the command line.
. Restart Mule or the API gateway runtime.

If you update the Runtime Manager agent, you must also run the Anypoint Monitoring agent uninstall script and then re-install the Anypoint Monitoring agent.
See xref:monitoring::am-installing.adoc#update-the-anypoint-monitoring-agent[Update the Anypoint Monitoring Agent].


=== What Happens When You Update the Agent

When you update the agent, the `amc_setup` script:

* Backs up the current version of the agent:
** Archives the `$MULE_HOME/plugins/MULE_AGENT_PLUGIN_FOLDER` to `$MULE_HOME/tools/mule-agent-backup.zip`
** Archives any custom modules (usually located in `$MULE_HOME/plugins/MULE_AGENT_PLUGIN_FOLDER/lib/modules`) to `$MULE_HOME/tools/mule-agent-modules-backup.zip`
* Updates agent libraries in `$MULE_HOME/plugins/MULE_AGENT_PLUGIN_FOLDER/lib`
* Retains the current `$MULE_HOME/conf/mule-agent.yml` configuration file
* Leaves modules in `$MULE_HOME/plugins/MULE_AGENT_PLUGIN_FOLDER/lib/modules` unchanged
+
This folder contains all custom modules added to the agent (not included in the agent distribution).

== Uninstall the Agent

To uninstall the agent:

. Stop Mule or the API gateway runtime.
. Remove these files:
+
`$MULE_HOME/conf/mule-agent.jks`
+
`$MULE_HOME/conf/mule-agent.yml`
. Restart Mule or the API gateway runtime.


== amc_setup Parameters
