= Create an Anypoint VPN

== Prerequisites

You must create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) before you can create a VPN. See xref:runtime-manager::virtual-private-cloud.adoc[Virtual Private Cloud] for more information. 

You should also ensure that the components of your external network are configured correctly.

When creating or configuring a VPN, you must provide the following information:

* *Remote IP address:* IP address of the device you are connecting to.
* *Pre-shared Key (PSK):* Shared secret used by the network tunnel that connects Anypoint Platform and your network. This value will be auto-generated if you select *Automatic Tunnel Configuration*.
* *Point-to-Point CIDR:* IP range used by the network tunnel. You must configure a unique IP address range for each tunnel. This value will be auto-generated if you select *Automatic Tunnel Configuration*.
* *Remote and Local Autonomous System Number (ASN)*: Specifies the collection of routing prefixes. You must configure both a remote and local ASN before creating a VPN. This is required only if you are using dynamic routing.
* *Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)*: Specifies the routing address of your network. This is required only if you are using static routing.

== Create a VPN

. From the Anypoint Management Center, select *Runtime Manager*.
. Go to the environment where you want to create a VPN.
. Click the *VPNs* tab, then click *Create VPN*.
. Enter or select the following information for your VPN: +
* *Name* - Enter a name for your VPN. 
* *VPC* - From the drop-down list, select the Virtual Private Cloud for the VPN connection.
* *Remote IP Address* - Enter the remote IP address to use to connect to the VPN.
. Select the routing type to use: 
+
[NOTE]
You can select either *BGP* or *Static*. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) type is recommended if it is supported by your device.
+
.. To use BGP, select *BGP* and enter the following values: +
* *Remote ASN* - Enter the ASN corresponding to your backend. The default value is `65001`.
* *Local ASN* - Assign an ASN for the MuleSoft side. The default value is `64512.`
.. To use static network routing select *Static*, and click *Add New Rule*: +
In the *CIDR* field, enter a Classless Inter-Domain Routing address. For example: `10.0.0.0/8`
. Select the *Tunnel Configuration* to connect Anypoint Platform and your network. +
* *Automatic* - Automatically configures the required tunnels for your VPN.
* *Custom* - Allows you to manually configure the tunnels used by your VPN. +
Each Anypoint VPN connection has two tunnels that each use a unique public IP address. It is important to configure both tunnels for redundancy. In the case of a custom configuration, you can use the same PSK value for both connections, but you must use different point-to-point CIDR ranges.
.. In the *PSK* field, enter a value for the PSK. +
The PSK must be between 8 and 64 characters in length and cannot start with zero (0). Allowed characters are alphanumeric characters, periods (.), and underscores ( _ ).
.. In the *Point-to-Point CIDR* field, enter the range of inside IP addresses for the VPN tunnel. +
You can specify a size /30 CIDR block from the 169.254.0.0/16 range. The CIDR block must be unique across all VPN connections. +
You cannot use the following CIDR blocks: 
+
----	
169.254.0.0/30
169.254.1.0/30
169.254.2.0/30
169.254.3.0/30
169.254.4.0/30
169.254.5.0/30
169.254.169.252/30
----
. Click *Create VPN*.

[NOTE]
You cannot modify tunnel options after you create the VPN connection. To change the settings for an existing connection, you must delete the VPN connection and create a new one. 

== Result

After creation, the new VPN appears in the list of VPNs. Initially, the *Status* column displays *PENDING* and both VPN tunnels display *DOWN*. Once your VPN connection is successful, the status changes to *AVAILABLE* and *UP*.
