== Prerequisites

You must create an Anypoint Virtual Private Cloud (Anypoint VPC) before you can create an Anypoint VPN. See xref:virtual-private-cloud.adoc[Virtual Private Cloud] for more information. 

You should also ensure that the components of your external network are configured correctly.

One Anypoint VPC can accommodate up to 10 Anypoint VPNs.

When creating or configuring an Anypoint VPN, you must provide the following information:

* *Remote IP address:* IP address of the device you are connecting to.
* *Pre-shared Key (PSK):* Shared secret used by the network tunnel that connects Anypoint Platform and your network. This value will be auto-generated if you select *Automatic Tunnel Configuration*.
* *Point-to-Point CIDR:* IP range used by the network tunnel. You must configure a unique IP address range for each tunnel. This value will be auto-generated if you select *Automatic Tunnel Configuration*.
* *Remote and Local Autonomous System Number (ASN)*: Specifies the collection of routing prefixes. You must configure both a remote and local ASN before creating an Anypoint VPN. This is required only if you are using dynamic routing.
* *Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR)*: Specifies the routing address of your network. This is required only if you are using static routing.

== Create an Anypoint VPN

. From the Anypoint Management Center, select *Runtime Manager*.
. Go to the environment where you want to create an Anypoint VPN.
. Click the *VPNs* tab, then click *Create VPN*.
. Enter or select the following information for your Anypoint VPN: +
* *Name* - Enter a name for your Anypoint VPN. 
* *VPC* - From the drop-down list, select the Virtual Private Cloud for the Anypoint VPN connection.
* *Remote IP Address* - Enter the remote IP address to use to connect to the Anypoint VPN.
. Select the routing type to use: 
+
[NOTE]
You can select either *BGP* or *Static*. Choose the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) type if your device supports it.
+
.. To use BGP, select *BGP* and enter the following values: +
* *Remote ASN* - Enter the ASN corresponding to your backend. The default value is `65001`.
* *Local ASN* - Assign an ASN for the MuleSoft side. The default value is `64512.`
.. To use static network routing select *Static*, and click *Add New Rule*: +
In the *CIDR* field, enter a Classless Inter-Domain Routing address. For example: `10.0.0.0/8`
. Select the *Tunnel Configuration* to connect Anypoint Platform and your network. +
* *Automatic* - Automatically configures the required tunnels for your Anypoint VPN.
* *Custom* - Allows you to manually configure the tunnels used by your Anypoint VPN. +
Each Anypoint VPN connection has two tunnels that each use a unique public IP address. It is important to configure both tunnels for redundancy. In the case of a custom configuration, you can use the same PSK value for both connections, but you must use different point-to-point CIDR ranges.
.. In the *PSK* field, enter a value for the pre-shared key. +
The PSK must be between 8 and 64 characters in length and cannot start with zero (0). Allowed characters are alphanumeric characters, periods (.), and underscores ( _ ).
.. In the *Point-to-Point CIDR* field, enter the range of inside IP addresses for the Anypoint VPN tunnel. +
You can specify a size /30 CIDR block from the 169.254.0.0/16 range. The CIDR block must be unique across all Anypoint VPN connections. +
You cannot use the following CIDR blocks: 
+
----	
169.254.0.0/30
169.254.1.0/30
169.254.2.0/30
169.254.3.0/30
169.254.4.0/30
169.254.5.0/30
169.254.169.252/30
----
. Click *Create VPN*.

[NOTE]
You cannot modify tunnel options after you create the Anypoint VPN connection. To change the settings for an existing connection, you must delete the Anypoint VPN connection and create a new one. 

== Result

After creation, the new Anypoint VPN appears in the list of Anypoint VPNs. Initially, the *Status* column displays *PENDING* and both Anypoint VPN tunnels display *DOWN*. Once your Anypoint VPN connection is successful, the status changes to *AVAILABLE* and *UP*.
