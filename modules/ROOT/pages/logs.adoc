[TIP]
This document deals with calling the xref:cloudhub-api.adoc[CloudHub API]. For instructions on how to perform these same tasks more easily via the Runtime Manager UI, see xref:cloudhub.adoc[CloudHub].

The logs API allows you to search your logs. All resources or methods that return or accept a type (except where noted) use the application JSON type. As an example, here's an example of what the result from a log search looks like.

[source,json,linenums]
----
{
"data":
  [
    {
      "message": "Deploying application to 1 workers.",
      "priority": "SYSTEM",
      "sequenceNumber": 1343797858127,
      "timestamp": 1344872571834
    }
  ],
