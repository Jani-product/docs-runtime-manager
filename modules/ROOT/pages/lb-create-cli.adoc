You can create a dedicated load balancer using the Anypoint Platform CLI.

== Prerequisites

To create a load balancer, ensure that you perform the following:

* Ensure that you are an administrator in the organization where you are creating the load balancer.
* Create an Anypoint Virtual Private Cloud (Anypoint VPC) in the organization where you want to create a load balancer.
* Create at least one certificate and private key for your certificate.

== Create a Load Balancer

To create a load balancer from the CLI, use the `cloudhub load-balancer create`. This command enables you to specify the VPC where the load balancer is created. It also enables you to specify the certificate and private keys used by the load balancer.
