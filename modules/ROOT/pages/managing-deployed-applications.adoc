After you deploy apps, use the Runtime Manager console to monitor and manage running applications. The different management functionalities available depend on the xref:deployment-strategies.adoc[deployment strategy] you use. 

The basic management tools in the Runtime Manager console allow you to perform the following tasks : 

* <<start_stop_delete_app, Start, stop, and delete apps>>
* <<status_states, View status states for apps>>
* Update your apps
* Monitor and troubleshoot apps

=== Applications Tab

In Runtime Manager, an application is a Mule application that is running on a Mule runtime engine (Mule) or an API gateway runtime instance. The instance can be running in CloudHub, in an on-premises server of your organization, in a group of servers, or in a server cluster.

In the *Applications* menu you can get a quick view of the applications that are currently deployed and running for your account. Click an entry to display additional information (as shown below), or click *Manage Application* to see the application's xref:monitoring-dashboards.adoc[dashboard] and settings page:

image::amc-manageapplication.png[AMC_ManageApplication]

After you create at least one application, you can see your applications listed here.

An application deployed to a server group runs on every server in the group.

=== Servers Tab

[NOTE]
This tab is only used to deploy apps to on-premises servers. CloudHub workers aren't displayed here.

In Runtime Manager, a server is a Mule or API gateway instance in a location other than CloudHub (on-premises or in a different cloud server) that you must first register in the Runtime Manager console. Once registered and configured in this tab, you can deploy your applications to it through the *Applications* tab.

image::amc-servers2.png[AMC_Servers]

From the *Servers* tab, select one of the following options to perform these tasks:

* Add a Server (registers the server with the Runtime Manager console)
* Start Mule or API gateway
* Create a server group
* Create a cluster
* Add and remove servers from a server group
* Add and remove servers from a cluster
* Stop an application on a server
* Delete a server, server group or cluster


For more about the options on this tab, see xref:managing-servers.adoc[Managing Servers].

=== Switch Environments

If you have multiple environments in your organization, you can switch between them. 

. From any screen in Runtime Manager, click the current environment, which is displayed in the upper left corner of the screen.
. Select the environment to switch to.  
. Click *Switch*.

[[start_stop_delete_app]]
== Start, Restart, Stop, or Delete an Application

. In *Applications*, click an application to open its management panel on the right side of the screen. 
. Next to the status, click the down-arrow (the menus differ according to the app's current state):
+
image::amc-restartapp.png[AMC_StopStartDeleteApp]
+
. Click the action to perform: + 
* *Start* - Starts stopped applications
* *Restart* - Resets applications that have already started. If the application is undeployed, the application's ZIP file is sent to the server to start the application on the server.
* *Stop* - Stops running applications.
* *Delete* - Deletes the application.

[IMPORTANT]
On CloudHub, after you delete an application, your log data is no longer accessible through the console. CloudHub archives old log data for a limited period of time before it is purged. This allows you to recover the data if needed. Open a support case at: https://support.mulesoft.com[https://support.mulesoft.com] for more information.

[NOTE]
====
For applications deployed through Pivotal Cloud Foundry:

* *Restart* - Redeploys your application on the virtual machine.
* *Stop* - Destroys the virtual machine running the application but retains the entry on Runtime Manager to keep log continuity.
* *Undeploy* - Destroys the virtual machine running the application and deletes the entry for it on Runtime Manager.

* *Undeployed* - Application no longer resides in the server.
* *Updated* - Application has been updated.

=== Replica Status States

Replica statuses apply only to applications deployed on Runtime Fabric. These statuses appear when you are applying new, or changed, configurations to deployed applications. See xref:runtime-fabric::app-versioning.adoc[Application Deployment Versioning] for more information.

Replica statuses include:

* *Started* (green) - The replica is receiving traffic.
* *Starting* - The process is starting on the replica.
* *Deleting* - The deletion of the replica is in progress.
* *Deleted* - The replica has been deleted.

== Applications Management Panel

If you select any of the applications on the *Applications* tab, a panel opens on the right. Here you can see additional information about the application and access its settings.

image::dashboard-ch.png[dashboard]

What the management panel displays depends on if your application is deployed on xref:managing-applications-on-cloudhub.adoc[CloudHub] or on xref:managing-applications-on-your-own-servers.adoc[your own servers]. You always see the status, the time of the last modification, and the deployed application ZIP file. Click the *Choose File* button to change the application ZIP file.

Applications on CloudHub display info about the CloudHub worker on which they run.

Applications deployed on clusters and server groups display the list of servers and the status of each.

Click *Manage Application* to access a menu where you can view and configure several more application settings:

image::managing-deployed-applications-38b94.png[]

In the app's settings page, you can view the *Dashboad* to see the full detail dashboard for your application. See xref:monitoring-dashboards.adoc[Monitoring Dashboards] for more info about what you see on the app's full detail dashboard.

image::managing-deployed-applications-107ad.png[]


Click the *Insight* button to see data at a transaction level. See xref:insight.adoc[Insight] for more information.

image::managing-deployed-applications-76124.png[]

[NOTE]
The dashboard and insights features are not currently available for Anypoint Platform Private Cloud Edition. See xref:deployment-strategies.adoc[deployment strategies].

== Monitor Applications

Depending on the xref:deployment-strategies.adoc[deployment strategy] used, different tools exist for monitoring events that occur on your application, as well as the performance of the servers or virtual servers it runs on. See xref:monitoring.adoc[Monitoring Applications] for more details.


== Update Your Application

If you made changes to your applications and want to upload a new version:

. Click *Choose file* on the deployment screen for that application.
. Select either *Import file from Exchange* or *Upload file*.
. Click *Apply changes* to use the new file for deployment. +
Within a few seconds, your application redeploys. While redeploying, the application status indicator changes to blue, and then turns green after the deployment completes.
. For applications deployed to CloudHub, you can click *Logs* to see a live redeployment of your application.

[TIP]
If you're deploying your application to an on-premises cluster, Runtime Manager installs the new app version progressively on each server to keep the service working with no downtime throughout the process.

To update applications deployed to Runtime Fabric, see xref:runtime-fabric::app-versioning.adoc[Application Deployment Versioning]

== Alerts

You can set up email alerts that are sent whenever certain events occur to your application, such as deployment failures or application deletions. These alerts can be linked to a specific application or to all of them. See xref:alerts-on-runtime-manager.adoc[Alerts] for instructions on how to do this.

All users of Anypoint Platform, even those without permissions to create alerts, can switch the alerts that are already created into an `active` or `inactive` state for their user. This determines what email alerts are sent to them.

[NOTE]
Switching an alert off from this view switches it off for the current (signed in) user only. Other users can still have active alerts.
