A server group is a set of servers that act as a single deployment target for applications so that you don't have to deploy applications to each server individually. Applications are deployed to each server in the server group through a single deployment and run in isolation from the application instances running on the other servers. 

Deploying applications to servers in server groups provides redundancy so that applications can be restored more seamlessly and quickly with less downtime. This also helps eliminate duplication of effort because there is no need to restore each application separately.  

In Runtime Manager, you can create servers and server groups, and add servers to server groups. 


== Considerations 

* All servers in a server group must be running the same version of Mule runtime engine and the same version of Runtime Manager agent.
* You can create a server group with servers with the *Running* or *Disconnected* status, but these can't be in the same group as servers with the *Created* status. 
* You can create a server group with servers with the *Created* status.
* To add a server on which existing applications are currently running to a server group,  first stop and delete the applications from the server.
