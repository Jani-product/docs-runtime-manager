A server group is a set of servers that act as a single deployment target for applications, which provides the advantage of not having to deploy an application to each server individually. Applications are deployed to each server in the server group through a single deployment and run in isolation from the application instances running on the other servers. 

In Runtime Manager, you can create servers and server groups, and add servers to server groups.
