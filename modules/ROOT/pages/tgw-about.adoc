A transit gateway is a network hub that connects your on-premises networks to your VPCs.
The transit gateway simplifies your network connectivity by functioning
as a cloud router, managing your VPC connections and requiring only one connection from CloudHub.

Use transit gateway attachments to create a secure connection between your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and your private corporate networks.
You can add multiple transit gateway attachments if required. 

[NOTE]
The number of transit gateways you can add depends on the transit gateway entitlements available to your account.
Contact your MuleSoft account representative if you don't know how many entitlements are associated with your account. 


== Transit Gateway Routing

VPC supports static routing for transit gateway attachments.

You must configure the routes (subnets) in your network that you want to be accessible through the transit gateway attachments:

* On Anypoint Platform, add the AWS VPC routes to the transit gateway route table.
* On AWS, add the Anypoint VPC routes to the AWS VPC route table.


[NOTE]
A maximum of 95 route table entries is permitted per VPC, regardless of the number of transit gateway attachments.
Consolidate networks to the fewest number possible to avoid exceeding the limit.  

=== Limitations

For information about limitations when attaching a VPC to a transit gateway, 
see 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/tgw-vpc-attachments.html[Transit gateway attachments to a VPC] in the AWS documentation.
