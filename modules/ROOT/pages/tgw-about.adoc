Use CloudHub Transit Gateway to create a secure connection between your MuleSoft Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and your private corporate networks. You can add multiple transit gateway connections if required. 

[NOTE]
The number of transit gateways you can add depends on the transit gateway entitlements available to your account.
Contact your MuleSoft account representative if you don't know how many  entitlements you have on your account. 


== Transit Gateway Routing

CloudHub Transit Gateway supports static routing for transit gateway connections.

You must specify the routes (subnets) in your network that you want to be accessible through CloudHub Transit Gateway.

[NOTE]
A maximum of 95 route table entries is permitted per VPC, regardless of the number of transit gateway connections.
Consolidate networks to the fewest number possible to avoid exceeding the limit.
