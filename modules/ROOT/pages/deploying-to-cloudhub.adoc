image::rtm-deploy-to-own-servers.png[Configuration tabs on the Deploy Application page]
+
See <<configure-application-settings,Configure Application Settings>>.
. Click *Deploy Application*.




== Deploy an Application from Studio

You can deploy your applications directly from Studio to CloudHub.
This option is helpful if you want to deploy an application you're developing to an online test environment.

[NOTE]
--
You cannot deploy an application from Studio to the CloudHub *Design* environment.
The *Design* environment is specific to applications created in Anypoint Design Center.
--

To deploy from Studio to CloudHub:

. Open your application in Studio.
. In *Package Explorer*, right-click the project folder and select *Anypoint Platform > Deploy to CloudHub*.
. If this is your first time deploying from Studio, provide your login credentials for Anypoint Platform at the prompt.
+
Studio stores your credentials and uses them the next time you deploy to CloudHub.
+
You can manage these credentials by selecting *Anypoint Studio > Preferences > Anypoint Studio > Authentication*.
+
After you sign in, you see the *Deploy Application* page.
. Click tabs to configure application options:
+
.The arrow shows the configuration tabs on the *Deploy Application* page.
image::rtm-deploy-to-own-servers.png[Configuration tabs on the Deploy Application page]
+
See <<configure-application-settings,Configure Application Settings>>.
. Click *Deploy Application*.


== Deploy an Application from the Command Line 

To deploy a Mule app from the CloudHub command line interface (CLI):

. If you do not already have access to the Anypoint command line tool, install it. 
+
See xref:anypoint-platform-cli.adoc[Anypoint Platform CLI].
. Log into your Anypoint Platform account from the command line:
+
--
.. Enter your username:
+
`anypoint-cli --username="user"`
.. At the prompt, enter your password.
--
. Run the following command, replacing `myMuleApp` with the deployment name of your app and `/Users/exported-app-folder/my-mule-app.jar` with the path to the deployable archive (JAR or ZIP) file on your file system:
+
----
runtime-mgr cloudhub-application deploy myMuleApp /Users/exported-app-folder/my-mule-app.zip
----
+
The command-line utility displays a table of deployment information:
+
----

----
+
Once the app is deployed on CloudHub, you can view and manage it on Runtime Manager.
. If you want to stop the app from the command line, run the following command, replacing `app-name` with the deployment name of your app:
+
`runtime-mgr cloudhub-application stop app-name`

To exit the command line tool, press Ctrl+c twice.

For a complete list of the commands, see xref:anypoint-platform-cli.adoc[Anypoint Platform CLI].








== Configure Application Settings 

On the *Deploy Application* page, click the tabs to configure the application deployment.

=== Runtime Settings 

Runtime version::

The runtime version must the same Mule version used to develop your application.
For example, if you use the value 3.9.1 and your application uses the HTTP Connector introduced in Mule 4.1.1, your application won't deploy and the log will contain errors.

Once the application is deployed and running, if any security patches, OS updates, or critical bug fixes are released for the selected runtime version, CloudHub indicates that an update is available. 
See xref::cloudhub-app-runtime-version-updates.adoc[Updating the Runtime Version for CloudHub Apps].


Worker size::

Workers::

Region::
If you have global deployment enabled on your account, you can change the region to deploy your application to.
+
--
* Applications deployed to Europe automatically have their domain updated to:
+
`+http://myapplicationdomain.eu.cloudhub.io+`
* Applications deployed to Asia / Pacific automatically have their domain updated to:
+
`+http://myapplicationdomain.au.cloudhub.io+`
--

Automatically restart application when not responding::
CloudHub automatically restarts your application when the monitoring system discovers a problem with your application.
+
If this option is not selected, CloudHub produces all the log messages, notifications, and any configured alerts, but doesn't restart the application.
+
See xref:worker-monitoring.adoc[Worker Monitoring].
Persistent queues::
Enable persistent queues on your application to store data in an input queue to disk.

Persistent queues protect against message loss and enable you to distribute workloads across a set of workers.
Before you can take advantage of persistent queueing, your application must be set up to use queues.
See xref:cloudhub-fabric.adoc[Clustering] for more information.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If your Mule application is using batch component and persistent queues,
you might see batch records being processed multiple times.
All batch records are stored in Amazon SQS and the visibility of the message is set to 70 seconds by default.
If your batch process takes longer than 70 seconds,
batch processes might see the same message again and process it multiple times.

To avoid this issue, set the `persistent.queue.min.timeout` system parameter in the *Properties* tab to a larger value.
For example, if your batch process takes 30 minutes to complete,
set the value to 'persistent.queue.min.timeout=2700000' milliseconds (45 Minutes).
The maximum value is 43000000 milliseconds (12 hours).

====
Encrypt persistent queues::
If you enable persistent queues, you can optionally encrypt the data stored in the input queue on disk.
Use Object Store v2::
Object Store v2 is enabled by default in Mule 4.
In Mule 3, select this option to access Object Store v2.
See xref::object-store.adoc[Object Store V2].

Enable Monitoring and Visualizer::
Use Anypoint Monitoring and Visualizer for Mule applications running on supported versions of Mule.
+
This option appears only you if have a Titanium subscription to Anypoint Monitoring and it is enabled for your organization.

==== Worker Size and vCores 

On each application, workers are responsible for executing the application logic.

Only running applications count toward workers usage.
Stopped applications do not consume vCore availability.

Worker sizes have different compute and memory capacities, including:

[%header,cols="2*a"]
|===
|Worker Size |Heap Memory
|0.1 vCores |500 MB
|0.2 vCores |1 GB
|1 vCore |1.5 GB
|2 vCores |3.5 GB
|4 vCores |7.5 GB
|8 vCores |15 GB
|16 vCores |32 GB
|===

Workers that have less than 1 vCore capacity (0.1 vCores and 0.2 vCores) offer limited CPU and IO for smaller work loads.
Each worker has 8 GB of storage, which is used for both system and application storage.

Workers running on fractional vCores (0.1 vCores and 0.2 vCores) have the ability to burst to higher CPU speeds for a short duration of time.
This is useful for improving application start-up times and with processing infrequently large workloads.
Allocating workers with 1 vCore or greater is recommended if consistency of performance is needed.

Applications with greater storage needs (for example, verbose logging) should use one of the larger worker sizes--2 vCores or 4 vCores, which have additional storage as follows:

* 1 vCore workers have an additional 4 GB of storage
* 2 vCores workers have an additional 32 GB of storage
* 4 vCores workers have an additional 80 GB of storage
* 8 vCores workers have an additional 160 GB of storage
* 16 vCores workers have an additional 320 GB of storage

[IMPORTANT]
--
The workers with additional storage listed above are available only for Mule version 3.6.2 or later, or API gateway version 2.0.2 or later.
+
It is recommended to access the additional storage at /tmp.
--

Select the options from the drop-down menu to configure the computing power you need:

image::workersizeandqty.png[WorkerSizeAndQty]

Depending on how many vCores are allocated to your account, some of these options may not be applicable, as you may not have enough available capacity.

[IMPORTANT]
If you select more vCores than are available in your account, CloudHub allows you to create the application using the console, but you cannot start your application until the vCores are available.

When deploying an application with more than one worker, CloudHub automatically balances any incoming traffic load across your allocated workers. For more information, see xref:cloudhub-fabric.adoc[Clustering].


=== Properties 

You can specify properties (key-value pairs) that the application uses during deployment and while running.

See xref:cloudhub-manage-props.adoc[Managing Properties for Applications on CloudHub] and xref:secure-application-properties.adoc[Safely Hiding Application Properties].

When you deploy an application from a non-production environment (*Get from sandbox*), the new application inherits any properties defined in the original application.
You can update these properties as required on the *Properties* tab before deploying the application.

=== Insight

Specify metadata options for the Insight analytics feature.
See xref:insight.adoc[Insight].

=== Logging

CloudHub stores activity logs, which can be viewed or downloaded from Runtime Manager.
See xref:viewing-log-data.adoc[Viewing Log Data].

You can configure the logging level for the application: `DEBUG`, `WARN`, `ERROR`, or `INFO`.

Alternatively, you can configure logging by modifying the `level` value in the `log4j2.xml` file.
See xref:mule-runtime::logging-in-mule.adoc#configuring-custom-logging-settings[Configuring Custom Logging Settings] and https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html[Apache Logging Services].

== Static IPs Address 

To enable a static IP address for your application, go to the *Static IPs* tab, then select the *Use Static IP* checkbox.

To pre-allocate static IP addresses for your application:
. Select a region from the *Region* menu on the *Runtime* tab
. Click *Use Static IP* on the *Static IPs* tab to allocate a static IP for the chosen region.

The static IP address is allocated when the application is deployed to that region.
If the application is already running, applying the static IP address change restarts the application with the newly-applied static IP address.

image::static-ip-regions.png[Static IPs by region]

By default, the number of static IP addresses allocated to your organization is equal to twice the number of production vCores in your subscription. This number is displayed under the *Use Static IP* checkbox.

If you need to increase this quota, please contact https://www.mulesoft.com/support-and-services/mule-esb-support-license-subscription[MuleSoft Support].

If an application has static IP addresses reserved in multiple regions,
it picks up the IP address from whichever region it is deployed to.
This allows you to pre-configure IP address rules for multiple regions for disaster recovery (DR) scenarios.

If you need to free up some of your overall static IP allocation, you can release a static IP that is currently allocated to an application.



=== Autoscaling* tab

This tab doesn't appear by default.
See xref:autoscaling-in-cloudhub.adoc[Autoscaling in CloudHub].






== Application Names 

Applications are always deployed with public application names in the `cloudhub.io` domain. 

The application name identifies your application in Runtime Manager and must be globally unique across CloudHub to avoid domain conflicts.

Runtime Manager alerts you if the name is already in use.

Application names can contain between 3 and 42 alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and dashes (-).
They cannot contain spaces or other characters.

For this reason, create a naming convention for your applications.
For example, you can always prefix your applications with `mycompany` and optionally a department name: `mycompany-mydept-myapplication`.
You can then add your own DNS records to hide this complex application name.
For example, you can route requests to `myapplication.mycompany.com` to `mycompany-mydept-myapplication.cloudhub.io`.

The application domain identifies your application in Runtime Manager and also provides you with a public URL for accessing the application if it exposes any inbound endpoints.
The format of the URL is `+http://myapplicationdomain.cloudhub.io+`.
For example, an application named `abcde` is accessible at `+http://abcde.cloudhub.io+`.

With the CloudHub dedicated load balancer, you can optionally implement mapping rules to set your application's public URL to any other path you choose, as long as you own the domain.






== Deployment Execution

CloudHub uploads your application and automatically begins the deployment process. During this process, your view is switched to the log view, allowing you to monitor the process of your application deployment. This process might take several minutes.

During the deployment, the application status indicator changes to yellow to indicate the deployment is in progress.

When deployment is complete, the application status indicator changes to green, and you are notified in the status area that the application has deployed successfully. Here's what is in the logs:

----
Successfully deployed [mule application name]
----

[NOTE]
While you deploy an application on Mule runtime engine version 4.1.x and later, the xref:api-manager::gatekeeper.adoc#how-gatekeeper-works[Gatekeeper] mechanism works with xref:api-manager::api-auto-discovery-new-concept.adoc[API Autodiscovery] to help determine the readiness of a deployment. If Gatekeeper considers the application not ready in five minutes, then the deployment status is failed.



[[move_app_from_sandbox_to_prod]]
== Move an Application from Sandbox to Production

If you created and tested an application in a sandbox environment, when you are ready to deploy the application, you must first move the application from the sandbox environment to the production environment.

. Sign into your Anypoint Platform account, and go to your production environment.
. In the *Applications* tab, click the *Deploy Application* button.
. Click *Get from sandbox* to select the application to move to production.
+
image::deploying-to-cloudhub-d6f7a.png[]
. In the *Get from sandbox* dialog, select your sandbox environment, select an application to deploy to production, then click *Apply*.
+
Optionally, select the *Merge environment variables and mule version* checkbox to copy the environment variables and Mule version from the source application you selected.
. Continue setting up your deployment as you would with any other deployment.

=== Limitations

* Only a CloudHub Administrator can move applications between environments.
* To avoid domain name conflict, an application with the same name cannot be deployed in two environments at the same time. Modify the application's name slightly to deploy it to another environment.
* Runtime Manager prevents you from duplicating applications in a single environment, so you cannot move an application into the environment it's already in. To have the same, or similar, applications in a single environment, modify one application's file to distinguish it from the original.

== Runtime Tab



== Properties Tab

You can optionally specify properties that your application requires. This allows you to externalize important pieces of the configuration that may switch depending on the environment into which you're deploying. For example, if you're using a Mule application locally, you might configure your database host to be `localhost`. But if you're using CloudHub, you might configure it to be an Amazon RDS server.

To create an application property, click the *Properties* tab and set the variable by using either a text  `key=value` format or by using the list format with two text boxes. After you have made the change, click *Apply Changes*.

image::deploying-to-cloudhub-cff02.png[]

These application properties can be used inside your Mule configuration. For example:

[source,xml,linenums]
----
<spring:bean id="jdbcDataSource" class="org.enhydra.jdbc.standard.StandardDataSource" destroy-method="shutdown">
   <spring:property name="driverName" value="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"/>
   <spring:property name="url"value="${database.url}"/>
</spring:bean>
----

[NOTE]
In text format, the backslash (`\`) character is used as an escape character. For example, to use `:` in key or value, you can put `\:` in the text. To use `\`, `\\` is needed.
No escape character is required in list format.

=== Overriding Properties in CloudHub vs. On-Premises Mule

Just like with on-premises Mule deployments, applications that you deploy to CloudHub can still bundle their own property placeholder or secure property placeholder files inside the deployable archive file. CloudHub substitutes these properties into the application when the application starts.

With an on-premises Mule, there are a couple of ways you can override property values bundled inside the application:

. You can configure an external location to add property or secure property placeholder files to override properties.

. You can set Java system environment variables at deployment time to override properties.

For example, to use the second option, with an on-premises server you could deploy your application with the following command:

----
mule -M-Dsecret.key=toSecretPassword -M-Denv=prod -M-Ddb.password=secretPassword -app myApp.zip
----

In this case, all the values typed into the command are stored only in memory; they are never stored in any file.

With CloudHub, techniques to override properties work differently.

The first approach is more difficult for CloudHub to translate because when an application is deployed into CloudHub it is harder to write override properties files into the file system.

The second approach is easier for CloudHub to handle because the Properties tab allows you to specify Java system environment variables that will function in the same way as adding environment variables when you deploy to an on-premises server. Read more about how to set these variables in xref:managing-applications-on-cloudhub.adoc#updating-environment-variables-and-application-properties[Managing Applications on CloudHub].

If you also have property names set in a `mule-app.properties` file inside your application, or in bundled property placeholder files, then when your application is deployed, any entries in the CloudHub Properties tab with the same name will override the matching value bundled with the application.

[NOTE]
It is possible to change the behavior of the application to not allow CloudHub properties to override properties bundled with the deployable archive. You do this by changing the options in the Property Placeholder element in the Mule application to prefer property placeholder files over JVM system environment variables. See http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/config/PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer.html[Spring documentation on Property Placeholder options] for more information on non-default property placeholder options.

=== Overriding Secure Properties

You can flag application properties as secure so that their values are not visible to users at runtime or passed between the server and the console. You can also include an `applications.properties` file in your application bundle, which can include properties that are marked as secure, so they are automatically treated as such.

Secure properties can also be overridden by new values you set at runtime in the Runtime Manager console. See xref:secure-application-properties.adoc[Secure Application Properties] for more information.




== Auto-Deploy a Proxy from API Manager

If you have registered an API in the Anypoint Platform, you can easily run it through an auto generated proxy to track its usage and implement policies. You can deploy this proxy to CloudHub without ever needing to go into the Runtime Manager section of Anypoint Platform.

From a menu in the API version page, you can trigger the deployment of your proxy and set up the CloudHub application name, environment, and gateway version to use. Then you can optionally access the Runtime Manager deployment menu for this proxy and configure advanced settings.




== Change a Deployed Application

You can change most of the settings after deploying application to CloudHub.

To edit an application's settings:

. In the *Applications* tab, select an application entry and click *Manage Application*.
. Click the *Settings* tab.


== Deployment Errors

If an error occurs and the application cannot be deployed, the application status indicator changes to `Failed` and the status area indicates that an error occurred.
Check the log details for any application deployment errors.
Correct the error, upload the application, and redeploy the application.
