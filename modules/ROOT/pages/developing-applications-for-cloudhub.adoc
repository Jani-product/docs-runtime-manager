Mule applications that are meant for deploying to CloudHub may sometimes require that you do things a little differently than for applications that are meant to be deployed to an on-premise server. For the most part, the same xref:mule-runtime::about-flows.adoc[Flows and Subflows] and xref:mule-runtime::global-elements.adoc[Global Elements] apply in the same way, but there are some specificities that you must consider. xref:deployment-strategies.adoc[Deployment Options] covers the key differences between both deployment environments, this document lists a few best practices to employ when deploying to CloudHub.

The xref:cloudhub.adoc[CloudHub] guide includes basic concepts and deployment examples.

== Specify an HTTP/HTTPS Host

If you employ any xref:connectors::http-connector.adoc[HTTP Connectors], define the Host address in a CloudHub configuration as 0.0.0.0. CloudHub routes requests from your application domain URL to the endpoint. If you deploy multiple xref:cloudhub-faq.adoc[workers], CloudHub load-balances incoming traffic automatically across these workers for you. As your application scales, work loads automatically distribute between your workers.

== Provide an External HTTP/HTTPS Port

If your application requires an externally accessible HTTP or HTTPS port to receive messages, trigger events, or expose a web service or user interface, declare the HTTP Listener port using the reserved property `${http.port}` or `${https.port}`. On CloudHub, port `${http.port}` or `${https.port}` is assigned automatically by the platform services. Traffic on port 80 to your application domain's URL is routed to `${http.port}` and traffic on port 443 is route to `${https.port}`.

To support routing to multiple CloudHub services over this port, you need to configure each with unique paths on the URL that is exposed. For example:

[source,console,linenums]
----
http://0.0.0.0:${http.port}/service/path/one
http://0.0.0.0:${http.port}/service/path/two
----

== Deployment Option Flexibility

If you want to deploy the same Mule application to different deployment targets, 
such as an on-premises server and CloudHub, 
see xref:mule-runtime::deploying.adoc[Deploy Mule Applications].

You can define properties and variables for each deployment outside of the application
and then reference them from your application.
For example, you can define a local value for the variable `http.port` or `https.port`.
For information, see xref:mule-runtime::configuring-properties.adoc[Configuring Properties].

You can also set these properties variables using Runtime Manager or the
Anypoint Platform command-line interface.

== Logging

All log messages from your application are captured by the CloudHub logging service and available through the log search tool in the Runtime Manager console.
To expose additional information in your logs for diagnostic or audit purposes, use the
xref:mule-runtime::logger-component.adoc[Logger component] for fine-grained logging of message content.

[IMPORTANT]
On CloudHub, after you delete an application, your log data is no longer accessible through the console. CloudHub archives old log data for a limited period of time before being purged. This allows you to recover the data if needed. Open a support case at: https://help.mulesoft.com[MuleSoft Help Center] for more information.

== Package Third-Party Libraries

CloudHub provides services in the platform that support connecting over different protocols and transforming many data formats.
All the standard Mule libraries are included and available to your application.
If you need to include another third-party library, you can package that library
in the application JAR file.
For information, see xref:mule-runtime::intro-packaging.adoc[Introduction to Mule 4: Packaging Applications].

== Access Resources Behind the Firewall

When developing an application that needs to access resources from inside your firewall, you can configure a xref:virtual-private-cloud.adoc[Anypoint Virtual Private Cloud (Anypoint VPC)] to host your xref:cloudhub-architecture.adoc#cloudhub-workers[CloudHub workers] and configure an IPSec tunnel to access your applications.


== Access Third-Party APIs and Services

CloudHub includes connectors for many third party applications, such as Salesforce, NetSuite, Twitter, and others. Anypoint Studio includes a few of the most common ones out of the box for developing with CloudHub, and the xref:connector-devkit::index.adoc[Anypoint Connector DevKit] documentation provides more detail on how to find and deploy these connectors with your application.

== Secure Properties

Note that you can flag application properties as secure so that their values are not visible to users at runtime or passed between the server and the console. See xref:secure-application-properties.adoc[Secure Application Properties] for more information.

== Add a UI for Your Application

Applications deployed to CloudHub can have a web UI using HTML and JavaScript. The AJAX Module provides support for interacting with your application from the browser and provides support for serving up static content.
