CloudHub continuously performs health checks on the underlying virtual machines where Mule applications are running.

A worker is impaired when there is a hardware or software failure that negatively impacts the running application deployed on the worker. Examples of hardware and software failures include network unavailability, memory issues, server hardware failures, file corruption, and so on.

When a worker is impaired, CloudHub automatically attempts to restart the worker and relaunch applications.

* If a retry is successful, the underlying worker and the Mule application are recovered without requiring any further action.
+
It might take up to five minutes for a worker to restart.
* If the application fails to start after five attempts, the status of the application is *Failed* or *Unrecoverable Runtime Error*.
+
In this case, you must manually redeploy and restart the application.

== Scheduled Maintenance Activities

CloudHub checks for scheduled maintenance activities for worker instances that cause potential downtime for the running applications: reboot, stop, start, or retirement of the instances.

To prevent downtime, Cloudhub sends you a notification in advance to restart your application with zero downtime.
