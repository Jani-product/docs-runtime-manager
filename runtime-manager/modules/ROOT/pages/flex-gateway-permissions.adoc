To see and use Flex Gateway Connected Mode capabilities, organizations must have a license.

Entitled organizations see a *Flex Gateway* tab in the Runtime Manager UI, and two new types of Runtime Manager permissions:

[%header,cols="20,30a"]
|===
|Permission | Description
|Manage Servers| Access to create flex gateways and replicas.
|Read Servers| Access to view flex gateways and replicas.
|===


Your Anypoint Platform Admin can add these permissions in Access Management. See xref:access-management::configure-teams.adoc#manage-team-permissions[Manage Team Permissions] for more information.

Your Anypoint Platform Admin can also add a Connected App with the appropriate permissions. See xref:access-management::connected-apps-overview.adoc[Connected Apps] for more information.

If you are using a Connected App to register Flex Gateway, it will need the following scopes:

* Manage Servers
* Read Servers
* View Organization
